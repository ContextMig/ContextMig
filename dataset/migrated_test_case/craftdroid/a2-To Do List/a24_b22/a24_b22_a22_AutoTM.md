### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
**ACTION (android.widget.TextView, txt_title, (20, 64), click, "Default"):** Clicking on this component has the potential to sort the displayed content by the default order. The component is tagged as clickable, and its text is 'Default', implying that it could return the user to the default settings or a default page.
 
**ACTION (android.widget.TextView, txt_count, (546, 64), click, "0"):** This component indicates count or quantity of a certain feature of the application. Given it has no click or longClick associated interaction, it's functionality will be inferred as a label showing a count of '0'.

**ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, fab_setting, (608, 64), click, NULL):** This button, when clicked, will likely open the settings menu. The 'fab' prefix in the id might denote that this is a floating action button, which are often used for primary actions in android applications, extending the functionality of the interface.

**ACTION (android.widget.TextView, txt_empty, (20, 771), click, "Genius only means hard-working all one's life."):** This component is likely a display label, showing a motivational text. It does not seem to respond to any user interactions.

**ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, fab_add, (556, 1428), click, NULL):** Clicking this button is likely to open a form or dialog that allows the user to add a new item or entity. The 'fab' prefix in the id suggests that this is a floating action button, which are used for primary actions, in this case, adding a new item or entity.
