### Semantics of Source Test case
> This test case is testing the functionality of adding a new to-do list, verifying its creation, and then deleting it in the SimplyDo Android application.
> 
> The detailed process with serial numbers is as follows:
> 
> 1. ACTION (EditText, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListEditText, (), input, "Sample Todo") : Input the text 'Sample Todo' into the 'New List Name' field and hide the keyboard.
> 2. ACTION (Button, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListButton, (), click, NULL) : Click on the 'Add' button to create a new to-do list.
> 3. ASSERT (TextView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/text1, (), wait_until_text_presence, "Sample Todo") : Verify that the new to-do list with the name 'Sample Todo' is present within 10 seconds.
> 4. ACTION (TextView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/text1, (), long_press, NULL) : Long press on the 'Sample Todo' to-do list to open the options menu.
> 5. ACTION (TextView, android:id/title, (), click, NULL) : Click on the 'Delete' option to delete the 'Sample Todo' to-do list.
> 6. ACTION (Button, android:id/button1, (), click, NULL) : Confirm the deletion by clicking on the 'Yes' button.
> 7. ASSERT (, , (), wait_until_text_invisible, "Sample Todo") : Verify that the 'Sample Todo' to-do list is no longer visible within 10 seconds.

### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````

ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, "Navigate up"): Clicking this button will navigate up or back in the application's hierarchy. It is a common control in android applications to provide a defined navigational path in the app.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (144, 93), click, "NULL"): This TextView displays 'Shopping List'. Even though there's no explicit interaction type defined, it's assumed to be of the click type by default. However, its purpose seems to be just to display information and not to trigger any action upon a click event.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, action_delete_checked, (448, 72), click, "Delete checked items"): Clicking this button deletes all items that the user has checked off in their shopping list. 
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (544, 72), click, "Sort"): This TextView represents a control which when clicked, triggers sorting functionality within the application. Long clicking can provide additional sorting options.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (640, 72), click, "More options"): This ImageView serves as a button that unlocks more options when it is clicked or long clicked.
ACTION (android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView, shoppingListView, (0, 176), longClick, "NULL"): This RecyclerView named 'shoppingListView' is a more advanced version of ListView. It is a container for displaying large data sets that can be scrolled very efficiently by maintaining a limited number of views. While there's no explicitly defined action aside from long clicking, this view typically contains multiple items that each have their own actions.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, fab_add, (576, 1456), click, "NULL"): Upon clicking this FloatingActionButton (defined as an ImageButton here), users will be able to add new items into their shopping list.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the source test case semantics, the first operation should be inputting text 'Sample Todo' into a text field. However, looking at the current page's intent, there's no EditText component to input text into. Therefore, we can't perform the first operation of the source test case on the current page. 

Let's consider the second operation from the source test case, which is clicking on the 'Add' button to create a new to-do list. Again, examining the current page's intent, there's no button that seems to serve the purpose of adding a new list. 

Given the current state of the target app and the source test case, it seems we can't perform any operations from the source test case on the current page of the target app. Therefore, we need to navigate to a different page in the target app where we can perform these operations. 

The 'Navigate up' button could potentially lead us to a page where we can add a new list. Therefore, the next action should be clicking on the 'Navigate up' button.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL): Navigate to a different page in the application's hierarchy where we can perform operations from the source test case.
~~~
Based on the provided information, the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action would be:

```python
d.click(0, 64)
```

This code will perform a click operation at the coordinates (0, 64) on the device screen.

Based on the given information, the next step in the migration would be to input a new list name into the appropriate field. However, the current page's intentions do not provide an element that would allow for this action. Therefore, we may need to navigate to a different page or open a different component on the current page. 

Given the intentions, we have a TextView with the id "android:id/text1" and the text "Shopping List" that, when clicked, might navigate to the shopping list. This could potentially be the equivalent of the 'New List Name' field in the source application. 

So, the next step would be to try to click on this TextView to see if it allows us to input a new list name. 

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (0, 176), click, NULL): Navigate to the shopping list to add a new item.
~~~
Based on the provided information, the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action would be:

```python
d.click(0, 176)

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we have navigated to the shopping list page where we can add a new item. This aligns with the first two actions from the source test case where we input a new to-do list name and confirm its creation. We can now proceed with the following action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (576, 1456), click, NULL): Click on the button to add a new item to the Shopping List.
~~~

This action matches the functionality of the source test case's action of clicking the 'Add' button after inputting the text 'Sample Todo'. However, the target app may require an additional step of inputting the to-do list name after clicking the 'Add' button. This will be confirmed in the next step of the migration.
Based on the given information, the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the action would be:

```python
d.click(576, 1456)
```

This code will click on the button at the coordinates (576, 1456) to add a new item to the Shopping List.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, action_delete_checked, (448, 72), click, "Delete checked items"): Clicking this item deletes all items that have been marked as "checked" in the shopping list. This event results in the removal of those items from the list.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (544, 72), click, "Sort"): This button is for sorting items in the list. A click opens a sort dialog, where items can be sorted by different aspects. A long click could offer secondary sorting options.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (640, 72), click, "More options"): This is likely a menu button that opens up additional options when clicked, though the exact options are not specified here.
ACTION (android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView, shoppingListView, (0, 176), click, NULL): This component likely contains the list of shopping items. A long click event might allow dragging and dropping to rearrange list items.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, fab_add, (576, 1456), click, NULL): Click on this floating action button to likely add new items to the shopping list. However, the action button doesn't provide a description, as it is often represented just by an icon.

Based on the provided information, the next step in the test case migration would be to delete the 'Sample Todo' item. However, the earlier attempt to delete the item by clicking on the 'Delete' option failed. 

Given the current page's intentions, there is no explicit delete action. However, a long press on the RecyclerView component which contains the list of shopping items might bring up additional options, which could potentially include the delete option. 

Since the long press on the RecyclerView component has been executed successfully in the past and brought up additional options, it would be reasonable to try this action again. 

Therefore, my suggestion for the next step in the test case migration would be to perform a long press on the RecyclerView component containing the 'Sample Todo' item to bring up additional options, and then attempt to find and click the 'Delete' option.

Here is the output:

~~~
ACTION (android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView, shoppingListView, (0, 176), longClick, NULL): Long press on the 'Sample Todo' item to bring up additional options.
~~~
Based on the provided information, the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action would be:

```python
d.long_click(0, 176, 1)
```

This code will perform a long click on the 'Sample Todo' item at the coordinates (0, 176) on the android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView. The '1' in the long_click function represents the duration of the long click.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (), click, NULL): Click on the 'Delete' option to delete the 'Sample Todo' to-do list
ASSERT (android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView, shoppingListView, (0, 176), wait_until_text_invisible, "Sample Todo"): Verify that the 'Sample Todo' to-do list is no longer visible within 10 seconds.
~~~
Based on the provided information, the UIAutomator2 code in Python would be:

```python
# Click on the 'Delete' option
d(text="Delete").click()

# Verify that the 'Sample Todo' to-do list is no longer visible within 10 seconds
for _ in range(10):
    if not d(resourceId="com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListView").child(text="Sample Todo").exists:
        break
    time.sleep(1)
else:
    assert False, "'Sample Todo' to-do list is still visible after 10 seconds"
```

In the above code, we first click on the 'Delete' option. Then, we wait for up to 10 seconds to verify that the 'Sample Todo' to-do list is no longer visible. If the 'Sample Todo' to-do list is still visible after 10 seconds, an assertion error is raised.

Based on the executed action sequence, it seems like we have successfully migrated steps 1 to 4 of the source test case to the target application. However, we have encountered an issue with step 5, the delete operation. The 'click' action on the 'Delete' option has failed twice, which indicates that the delete operation in the target application might be different from the source application.

Looking at the current page's intentions, there's no explicit 'Delete' action described. However, there's a 'longClick' action on the 'RecyclerView' element (shoppingListView) that might lead to additional interactive options such as editing or deleting an item in the shopping list. This could be our next step.

Let's try to execute a 'longClick' action on the 'Sample Todo' item again, but this time, instead of trying to click on the 'Delete' option, we will swipe to the left. Swiping to the left is a common gesture for deleting items in many Android applications, so it's worth a try.

Here's the next step of the migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView, shoppingListView, (0, 176), longClick, NULL): Long press on the 'Sample Todo' item to bring up additional options.
ACTION (android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView, shoppingListView, (0, 176), swipe_left, NULL): Swipe to the left on the 'Sample Todo' item to attempt to delete it.
~~~
Based on the given actions, the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python would be:

```python
d(resourceId="com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListView").child(index=0).long_click(1)
d(resourceId="com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListView").child(index=0).swipe("left")
```

In the above code, we are performing a long click and a left swipe on the first child of the RecyclerView with the id 'shoppingListView'. The 'index=0' is used to select the first child of the RecyclerView. The '1' in the long_click method is the duration for which the long click is performed. The 'left' in the swipe method indicates the direction of the swipe.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it seems that the 'Delete' option for the 'Sample Todo' list item is not being activated by a long press or a swipe left gesture. This suggests that the operation logic for deleting a list item in the target app is different from that of the source app.

Given the current page's intentions, there isn't an explicit 'Delete' action available. However, there could be a possibility that the 'Sort' button reveals additional options, including a 'Delete' option. 

Therefore, the next step would be to click on the 'Sort' button to explore this possibility. If this doesn't reveal a 'Delete' option, we may need to consider other possibilities or even skip this step.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (544, 72), click, NULL): Click on the 'Sort' button to explore the possibility of revealing additional options including a 'Delete' option.
~~~
Based on the provided information, the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action would be:

```python
d.click(544, 72)
```

This code will click on the 'Sort' button at the coordinates (544, 72) on the device screen.
