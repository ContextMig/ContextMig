# Previous Page JSON:

Here is the parsed semantic extraction for the Current Page JSON you provided:

- ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, "Navigate up"): Click on this button to navigate up, possibly returning to the previous screen.

- ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (144, 93), click, "Shopping List"): Click on this to view the Shopping list. Since there's no interaction mentioned. we're assuming clicking as default action in this scenario.

- ACTION (android.widget.TextView, action_delete_checked, (448, 72), click, "Delete checked items"): Click on this button to delete checked items from your shopping list. This might prompt a confirmation pop-up to confirm the deletion.

- ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (544, 72), click, "Sort"): Click on this button to sort items on the list. A long click might provide additional sorting options.

- ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (640, 72), click, "More options"): Click on this image to view more options, which could include settings, preferences, help, and other non-primary functionalities. 

- ACTION (android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView, shoppingListView, (0, 176), NULL, NULL): This represents an interactive list of shopping items. Here, the action might depend on the current user context and can involve scrolling, clicking on an item, or long-pressing an item for more options.

- ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, fab_add, (576, 1456), click, NULL): Click this button to add a new item to the shopping list. As no description is provided, we can infer it from the UI conventions and the given ID (fab_add usually stands for Floating Action Button - Add).

Note: For actions with the value as NULL, we either don't have a description or can't infer one from the given information. The same applies to some purposes which can't be fully determined from the data. The actual purpose of these actions might vary based on the context in which they're used.
````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, the first step in the source test case is to click on the 'Skip' button to bypass any tutorial or introduction screens. However, there is no 'Skip' button in the current page's intent. Therefore, we can safely skip this step and move to the second step in the source test case, which is to click on the 'New Task' button to initiate the creation of a new task. 

On the current page, the equivalent action would be to click on the button to add a new item to the todo list. 

Here is the migrated action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, fab_add, (556, 1428), click, NULL): Click this button to save a new item to the todo list.
~~~
Based on the provided information, the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action would be:

```python
d.click(556, 1428)
```

This code will click on the coordinates (556, 1428) on the device screen, which corresponds to the 'fab_add' ImageButton. This action will save a new item to the todo list.

# Output:

ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, "Navigate up"): Click on this button to navigate back to prior page or section in the app. It doesn't change the state of any data but takes back to previous contents.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (144, 93), click, "Shopping List"): Clicking on this component may either do nothing or it may lead to a page giving users functionality to alter the given Shopping list. It visualizes the page name or title.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, action_delete_checked, (448, 72), click, "Delete checked items"): Clicking on this button will delete all the items that have been checked off on the shopping list. It starts the process of removing all the checked items from the list.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (544, 72), click, "Sort"): Click on this button to reorder the items in the shopping list according to user's preference. It could sort the shopping list items alphabetically or based on the time they were added or according to user's custom sorting preference. 

ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (640, 72), click, "More options"): Clicking this button displays more options regarding the current shopping list page. It provides the user with more functionalities and controls over the current content. 

ACTION (android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView, shoppingListView, (0, 176), longClick, NULL): Long clicking on this component could initiate bulk operations, like delete, move or copy of several items at the same time. It is a container for displaying large data sets that can be scrolled efficiently by maintaining a limited number of views.

ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, fab_add, (576, 1456), click, NULL): This floating action button is generally used to trigger the primary action in the UI. Clicking on this button presumably opens up a dialog or a new page to add a new item to the shopping list.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/et_new_task_name, (), input, "Sample Todo") : Input the task name 'Sample Todo' into the task name field.
ASSERT (TextView, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/tv_exlv_task_name, (), wait_until_text_presence, "Sample Todo") : Verify that the task with the name 'Sample Todo' is present within 10 seconds.
~~~
Based on the provided information, the UIAutomator2 code in Python would be:

```python
d(resourceId="com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/et_new_task_name").set_text("Sample Todo")
assert d(resourceId="com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/tv_exlv_task_name").wait(timeout=10).get_text() == "Sample Todo"
```

In the above code:

- `d(resourceId="com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/et_new_task_name").set_text("Sample Todo")` is used to input the task name 'Sample Todo' into the task name field.
- `assert d(resourceId="com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/tv_exlv_task_name").wait(timeout=10).get_text() == "Sample Todo"` is used to verify that the task with the name 'Sample Todo' is present within 10 seconds.

#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
Here's the semantic extraction for the current page based on the specified components.

1. ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, "Navigate up"): Clicking on this button navigates the user back up to the previous page or level in the app's hierarchy. 

2. ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (144, 93), click, "Shopping List"): This component is a static text display for the title "Shopping List". No user interaction is expected. 

3. ACTION (android.widget.TextView, action_delete_checked, (448, 72), click, "Delete checked items"): Clicking on this button deletes the items that have been checked/marked by the user in the shopping list.

4. ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (544, 72), click, "Sort"): Clicking on this button opens a list of sorting options allowing the user to sort the items in the shopping list. Long clicking might offer further sorting parameters.

5. ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (640, 72), click, "More options"): Clicking on this image offers the user additional options relating to the shopping list. Long clicking might offer alternative set of options.

6. ACTION (android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView, shoppingListView, (0, 176), longClick, NULL): This is a list view of the shopping items. User may perform a long click for interacting with the list items, possibly opening a context menu with more actions.

7. ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, fab_add, (576, 1456), click, NULL): Clicking on this floating button will probably initiate a process to add a new item to the shopping list.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, fab_add, (556, 1428), click, NULL): Click this button to save a new item to the todo list.
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (144, 93), wait_until_text_presence, "Sample Todo"): Verify that the task with the name 'Sample Todo' is present within 10 seconds.
~~~
Based on the given actions and assertions, the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python would be:

```python
# Click the button to save a new item to the todo list
d.click(556, 1428)

# Verify that the task with the name 'Sample Todo' is present within 10 seconds
assert d(text="Sample Todo").wait(timeout=10)
```

In the above code, `d` is the device variable name, and `click` is the action performed on the UI element at the coordinates (556, 1428). The `wait` function is used to wait until the text "Sample Todo" appears on the screen, with a timeout of 10 seconds. If the text does not appear within this time, the assertion will fail.

ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, "Navigate up"): This button allows you to navigate up or go back to the previous screen.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (144, 93), click, NULL ): The text "Shopping List" is displayed on the screen. Clicking on it, however, does not trigger any action or change in the interface.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, action_delete_checked, (448, 72), click, "Delete checked items"): Clicking on this button "Delete checked items" initiates the removal of the selected items from the shopping list.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (544, 72), click or longClick, "Sort"): This button provides sorting options for the shopping list items. The long click might yield additional options or configurations.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (640, 72), click or longClick, "More options"): This button provides access to more options. The specifics of these options and the actions they initiate are not clearly specified.
ACTION (android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView, shoppingListView, (0, 176), longClick, NULL ): This view shows the shopping list. Long click on an item might offer additional options like editing or deleting.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, fab_add, (576, 1456), click, NULL): This is a button for adding new items to the shopping list.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, action_delete_checked, (448, 72), click, "Delete checked items"): Click on the 'Delete checked items' button to delete the task 'Sample Todo'.
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (144, 93), wait_until_text_invisible, "Sample Todo"): Verify that the task with the name 'Sample Todo' is no longer visible within 10 seconds.
~~~
Based on the provided information, the UIAutomator2 code in Python would be:

```python
# Click on the 'Delete checked items' button
d.click(448, 72)

# Verify that the task with the name 'Sample Todo' is no longer visible within 10 seconds
import time
start_time = time.time()
while time.time() - start_time < 10:
    if not d(text="Sample Todo").exists:
        break
    time.sleep(1)
assert not d(text="Sample Todo").exists
```

In the above code, we first perform the click action on the 'Delete checked items' button using the provided coordinates. Then, we wait for up to 10 seconds to verify that the task with the name 'Sample Todo' is no longer visible. We use a while loop to keep checking the existence of the 'Sample Todo' text on the screen until it disappears or 10 seconds have passed. If the 'Sample Todo' text is still visible after 10 seconds, the assert statement will fail, indicating that the task was not deleted successfully.
