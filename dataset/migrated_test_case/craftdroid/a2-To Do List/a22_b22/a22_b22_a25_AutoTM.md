### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
Based on your input, here's how I interpret the various elements and their potential purposes:

1. ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, "Navigate up"): Clicking on this button will navigate the user up one level in the application's hierarchy, returning to the previous screen or page. 

2. ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (144, 93), click, NULL): This represents the title "Shopping List" at the top of the screen. As it has no particular interaction, its purpose is merely to signify the current page as the Shopping List page.

3. ACTION (android.widget.TextView, action_delete_checked, (448, 72), click, "Delete checked items"): This button will delete all items in the shopping list that have been marked or checked by the user. Clicking on it is expected to prompt a confirmation for deletion.

4. ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (544, 72), click, "Sort"): Clicking on this button sorts the list of shopping items in a certain order. A long click might reveal more detailed sorting options.

5. ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (640, 72), click, "More options"): This button serves as an entry point for more options related to the current screen or app, such as settings or help. Clicking on it will likely open a dropdown or slide-out menu.

6. ACTION (android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView, shoppingListView, (0, 176), click, NULL): This represents the main view or area where the shopping list items are displayed. A longclick may trigger additional actions such as item selection or mode switch.

7. ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, fab_add, (576, 1456), click, NULL): This floating action button (FAB) is used to add a new item to the shopping list. Clicking on it navigates the user to a page where they can input details about the new item.

ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, "Navigate up"): This button's click action will navigate the user up one level in the navigation stack. This primarily occurs in hierarchical interfaces, such as directories or menus.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (144, 93), click, NULL): This is the title field of the page, clicking on it typically doesn't perform any actions.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, action_delete_checked, (448, 72), click, "Delete checked items"): Click action will delete all items that have been checked off on the shopping list. This action is likely irreversible and may have a verification prompt.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (544, 72), click, "Sort"): Clicking on this element will sort the items on the page, possibly in an ascending or descending order. Long clicking might provide additional sorting options.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (640, 72), click, "More options"): This button likely opens a dropdown or popup menu with additional actions that aren't visible on the main screen.
ACTION (android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView, shoppingListView, (0, 176), longClick, NULL): This is a container element that likely holds list items. Long clicking on an element of this type often reveals additional options or actions pertaining to that element.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, fab_add, (576, 1456), click, NULL): The FloatingActionButton, represented here, will likely add a new item or create something new when clicked, such as a new shopping list item in this case.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (144, 93), input, "Sample Todo"): Input the text 'Sample Todo' into the title field.
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (144, 93), wait_until_text_presence, "Sample Todo"): Verify that the text 'Sample Todo' is present.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, fab_add, (556, 1428), click, NULL): Click on the add button to save the new todo item.
~~~
Based on the given actions, the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python would be:

```python
# Input the text 'Sample Todo' into the title field.
d.click(144, 93)
d.send_keys("Sample Todo")

# Verify that the text 'Sample Todo' is present.
assert d(text="Sample Todo").exists

# Click on the add button to save the new todo item.
d(resourceId="com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/fab_add").click()
```

Please note that the coordinates (144, 93) and (556, 1428) are used to interact with the UI elements. The resourceId "com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/fab_add" is used to identify the add button. The text "Sample Todo" is used to input the text and verify its presence.

Based on your input, here are the actions and their semantics:

- ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, "Navigate up"): Navigates up one level in the application's hierarchy. Typically placed in the top left corner, this button provides a user-friendly way of navigating the app.

- ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (144, 93), click, NULL): This button is labelled "Shopping List" and appears to be a clickable title of the page or section. It likely functions as a way to sort or filter the list of shopping items.

- ACTION (android.widget.TextView, action_delete_checked, (448, 72), click, "Delete checked items"): This control is a button with an expected interaction of 'click'. Its purpose is to clear any selected items from the shopping list by confirming their deletion.

- ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (544, 72), click, "Sort"): This button opens a menu that allows items to be sorted in various ways. It's also possible that a long click provides additional sorting options.

- ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (640, 72), click, "More options"): This button looks like it opens a dropdown menu with more app options. The action is likely to be clicking or long-clicking.

- ACTION (android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView, shoppingListView, (0, 176), click, NULL): The purpose of this rectangular area is to contain a scrollable list of shopping items. It's expected that long clicking on an item within the list might provide more options.

- ACTION (android.widget.EditText, new_item_description, (4, 1296), click, "New Item"): This editable text box is for inputting a new item into the respective shopping list. It likely updates the list upon confirmation.

- ACTION (android.widget.EditText, new_item_quantity, (4, 1387), click, "Quantity"): This editable text box is where the user inputs the quantity of the new item which they want to add to the shopping list.

- ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, button_add_new_item, (564, 1387), click, "Done"): This control is a button with an expected interaction of 'click'. Its purpose is to confirm and save a newly added item along with its quantity in the shopping list.
  
Remember, the list of items will not update until the 'Add new item' button is clicked.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
~~~
ASSERT (android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView, shoppingListView, (0, 176), wait_until_text_presence, "Sample Todo"): Verify that the text 'Sample Todo' is present within the list.
ACTION (android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView, shoppingListView, (0, 176), swipe_right, NULL): Swipe right on the todo item to reveal the delete button.
~~~
Based on the given actions, the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python would be:

```python
# Assertion to verify that the text 'Sample Todo' is present within the list
assert d(resourceId="com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListView").child(text="Sample Todo").exists

# Action to swipe right on the todo item to delete
d(resourceId="com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListView").child(text="Sample Todo").swipe("right")
```

Please note that the above code assumes that the 'Sample Todo' item is directly a child of the RecyclerView with id 'shoppingListView'. If the hierarchy is more complex, you might need to adjust the code accordingly.
