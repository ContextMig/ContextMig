Based on the provided information, the next action to perform is to input the description 'Sample Todo' for the new item. This corresponds to the second step in the source test case. The corresponding component in the target application is the `android.widget.EditText` with the ID `userToDoEditText`. 

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, userToDoEditText, (64, 321), input, "Sample Todo"): Input the description 'Sample Todo' for the new item.
~~~
Based on the given information, the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the action would be:

```python
d.click(64, 321)
d(resourceId="com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/userToDoEditText").set_text("Sample Todo")
```

In this code, we first click on the EditText field at the coordinates (64, 321). Then, we set the text of the EditText field with the id "userToDoEditText" to "Sample Todo".

# Output Semantics

ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 72), click, "Navigate up"): Click on this button to navigate back to the previous page. This operation does not change the current page but merely closes it, revealing the previous page underneath.

ACTION (bq, toDoCustomTextInput, (0, 296), click, "Title"): Click on this control to customize the text input field for the ToDo card title. This does not change the current page but simply allows the user to define the title of their new To-Do.

ACTION (android.widget.EditText, userToDoEditText, (64, 321), click, "Sample Todo"): Long-click on this control to edit the to-do name. Clicking on this EditText component will open the keyboard for text input. If the user has already entered some text, clicking will place the cursor at the clicked text location. 

ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, todoReminderAndDateContainerLayout, (0, 532), click, NULL): Click on this control to view or edit the reminder and date for the ToDo. The page after clicking this control is the reminder and date selection page.

ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, userToDoReminderIconImageButton, (72, 723), click, NULL): Click on this control to set a reminder for this ToDo card. Clicking on this control will open a dialog or window where the user can choose a date and time for the reminder. 

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, userToDoRemindMeTextView, (139, 725), click, "Remind Me"): Click on this button to toggle the reminder for this To-Do card. If "Remind Me" text is shown, it means that the reminder for this To-Do card is turned off, and vice versa. This inferable from the text context.

ACTION (android.widget.Switch, toDoHasDateSwitchCompat, (478, 728), click, "OFF"): Tap on the "OFF" button to set a due date for the ToDo item. When a user clicks this control, the switch would change the text to "ON" and additional options would appear to set a due date for the task.

ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, makeToDoFloatingActionButton, (576, 476), click, NULL): Click this button to finish creating the ToDo item. The page after clicking this control is the To-Do detail page, which includes details for a single To-Do item.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (32, 93), click, "Minimal"): This is the title of the app. Clicking on it might not perform any action as it represents static text.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (640, 72), click, NULL): Clicking this will open more options. 'More options' usually implies additional actions that the user can perform, possibly related to app settings, account details, etc.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, listItemLinearLayout, (0, 176), click, NULL): Clicking this element will probably open the detailed view of a list item. It might also provide additional options to modify the item.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, toDoListItemTextview, (154, 218), swipe_to_right, "Sample Todo"): Swiping this to-do item to the right will remove it.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, addToDoItemFAB, (576,1456), click, NULL): Clicking this button will create a new To-Do item. The create action here presumably opens a form for creating a new to-do item.

Based on the provided source test case semantics, current page's intent description, and the executed action sequence, it seems we have successfully migrated the first three steps of the source test case to the target application. 

The next step in the source test case is to verify the presence of the newly added item in the shopping list. In the current page's intent, there is a TextView with id 'toDoListItemTextview' that contains the text 'Sample Todo', which is the description of our newly added item. Thus, we can assert the presence of this item in the list.

Here is the next step of the test migration:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, toDoListItemTextview, (154, 218), wait_until_text_presence, "Sample Todo"): Verify that the item with the description 'Sample Todo' is present within 10 seconds.
~~~
Based on the provided information, the UIAutomator2 code in Python would be:

```python
assert d(resourceId="com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/toDoListItemTextview").wait(timeout=10).get_text() == "Sample Todo"
```

This code will wait for up to 10 seconds for the TextView with the specified resourceId to appear, and then verify that its text is "Sample Todo".

# Output

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (32, 93), click, "Minimal"): Click on "Minimal" Text View could filter the to-do items, leaving only the tasks with the minimal tag. This control does not have specifically defined interaction, so we assume a click by default.

ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (640, 72), click, "More options"): Click on this icon to show more options such as settings, help, and etc. This does not navigate to a new page but expands a dropdown menu.

ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, listItemLinearLayout, (0, 176), click, ""): Click on this item to open the detailed view of the to-do item. There might be more information such as deadline, note, and etc. 

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, toDoListItemTextview, (154, 218), swipe_to_right, "Sample Todo"): This interaction is expected to delete the to-do item titled "Sample Todo". Swiping to the right is often semantically linked with deletion of an item in many applications, especially task or email-oriented ones.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, toDoListItemTextview, (154, 218), swipe_to_left, "Sample Todo"): This interaction is expected to delete the to-do item titled "Sample Todo". Swiping to the left, much like swiping to the right, is often linked to deletion. It could be used as alternative way of deletion or have a different deletion behaviour. 

ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, addToDoItemFAB, (576, 1456), create, ""):  Click on this Floating Action Button (FAB) to create a new to-do item. This event is likely to trigger a dialog box or a new page where users can input the details of the new to-do item.
````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, toDoListItemTextview, (154, 218), swipe_to_right, "Sample Todo"): Swipe right on the item with the description 'Sample Todo' to remove it from the shopping list.
~~~
Based on the given information, the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action would be:

```python
d(text="Sample Todo").swipe("right")
```

In this case, we are using the text attribute of the widget to locate it and perform the swipe action. The text attribute is "Sample Todo", which is the description of the item in the shopping list. The swipe action is performed to the right, which is indicated by the "right" parameter in the swipe method.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, "", (32, 93), click, "Minimal"): This is the title text with no interactive function.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, "", (640, 72), click, "More options"): Click on this icon to get more options. It is usually situated at the top right of the application screen.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, "listItemLinearLayout", (0, 176), click, NULL): Represents an item in the to-do list which can be clicked to see more details. 
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, "toDoListItemTextview", (154, 218), swipe_to_right, "Sample Todo"): Swipe to right. from:[0, 80] to:[720, 128] to remove the to-do item. The action will remove 'Sample Todo' from the to-do list.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, "toDoListItemTextview", (154, 218), swipe_to_left, "Sample Todo"): Swipe to left. from:[0, 80] to:[720, 128] to remove the to-do item. The action will remove 'Sample Todo' from the to-do list.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, "addToDoItemFAB", (576, 1456), create, NULL): Clicking this 'Floating Action Button' will open a dialog or a new page to add a new Todo. This is a standard Android design pattern.


````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
~~~
ASSERT (, , (), wait_until_text_invisible, "Sample Todo"): Verify that the item with the description 'Sample Todo' is not visible within 10 seconds.
DONE
~~~
Based on the given input, the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python would be:

```python
import time

start_time = time.time()
while time.time() - start_time < 10:
    if not d(text="Sample Todo").exists:
        break
    time.sleep(1)
assert not d(text="Sample Todo").exists
```

This code will wait for up to 10 seconds for the text "Sample Todo" to disappear from the screen. If the text is still visible after 10 seconds, the assert statement will fail, indicating that the test case has failed.
````
