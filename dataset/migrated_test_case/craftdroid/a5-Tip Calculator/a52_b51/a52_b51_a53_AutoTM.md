### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Simple Tip Calculator, (16, 39), click, NULL): The Simple Tip Calculator control is clicked to calculate tips. Afterwards, the GUI elements don't significantly change between the current page and the next page, indicating that the click operation doesn't introduce a new widget or navigate to a new page, but it may trigger certain background processing.
ACTION (android.view.View, NULL, (10, 96), click, NULL): Opens the Advertisement page. After clicking this control, the current page does not change but the elements of the page are rearranged. The Advertisement has been removed and all the related elements such as Bill, Tip (%), Split, Calculate, Share, Copy, Total Bill, Total Tip, Per person have been moved upwards on the page.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Test Ad, (129, 96), click, NULL): Click on the 'Test Ad' widget. After this interaction, no new page appears nor any new widget.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/editTextBill, (150, 166), click, "100.00"): User clicks on the 'Bill' field to enter the bill amount. After clicking on it, the current page remains the same allowing for user input.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/editTextBill, (150,166), click, "100.00"): Click to edit the total bill amount. After clicking this control, the same page remains open with no changes in the GUI elements. Therefore, this action potentially opens the keyboard for the user to input the new bill amount.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/editTextTip, (225, 216), click, "15"): Modify the tip percentage. Click on this control does not navigate to a new page but allows to edit the percentage of tip on the bill. The pages before and after clicking this control are identical, with the same list of components. This means that the exact result of clicking this control entirely depends on the user's input.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/buttonTipMinus, (150, 216), click, "-"): Click to decrease the tip percentage. After clicking, the tip percent value in the EditText with the id "com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/editTextTip" decreases by 1%.

Based on the given source test case semantics, the current page's intent description, and the executed action sequence, the next step in the test migration should be to input '15' as the tip percentage into the appropriate EditText field. 

This corresponds to the second step in the source test case:

```
2. ACTION (EditText, com.appsbyvir.tipcalculator:id/tipEditText, (), input, "15") : Clear the tip percentage field, input '15' as the tip percentage, and hide the keyboard.
```

In the current page's intent description, the equivalent action is:

```
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/editTextTip, (225, 216), click, "15"): Click to enter or change the tip percentage amount. The page after clicking this control remains the same but allows for input in the tip percentage field.
```

Therefore, the next step is to perform this action.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/editTextTip, (225, 216), input, "15"): Clear the tip percentage field, input '15' as the tip percentage, and hide the keyboard.
~~~
Based on your instructions, here is the translation of the provided actions into uiautomator2 code in Python:

1. ACTION (EditText, com.appsbyvir.tipcalculator:id/tipEditText, (), input, "15") :
For this action, since the ID and input are known, we'll use them and the code becomes something like:
```python
d(resourceId="com.appsbyvir.tipcalculator:id/tipEditText").clear_text()
d(resourceId="com.appsbyvir.tipcalculator:id/tipEditText").set_text("15")
d.press("enter")
```

2. ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/editTextTip, (225, 216), click, "15"):
Since the coordinates are precise, we'll prefer them over any other identifier and the code becomes something like:
```python
d.click(225, 216)
```

3. ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/editTextTip, (225, 216), input, "15"):
Similarly to previous actions, since the ID and input are known, we'll use them and the code becomes something like:
```python
d(resourceId="com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/editTextTip").clear_text()
d(resourceId="com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/editTextTip").set_text("15")
d.press("enter")
```

Note: In every instance where an input operation was required, we pressed 'enter' to hide the keyboard after the input operation.

ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/textViewTotalToPay, (164, 396), wait_until_text_presence, "text:65.09"): Verify that the calculated total amount '65.09' is correctly displayed within 10 seconds.
~~~
Based on the provided input, the output (in the form of UIAutomator2 code in Python) would be represented as:

```python
assert d(resourceId="com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/textViewTotalToPay").wait(timeout=10.0).get_text() == "65.09"
```

This Python code will assert if the displayed text in the TextView with the resource id 'com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/textViewTotalToPay' matches the expected text '65.09' within 10 seconds. The method wait(timeout=10.0) gives the script a 10-second timeout before the assertion takes place. The code will not perform any action; it will merely verify the state of the TextView.
