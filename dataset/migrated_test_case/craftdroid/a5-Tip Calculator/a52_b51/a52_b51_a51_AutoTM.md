### Semantics of Source Test case
> ```
> This test case is testing the functionality of a tip calculator application that involves entering a bill amount, setting a tip percentage, and verifying the calculated total.
> 
> The detailed process with serial numbers is as follows:
> 
> 1. ACTION (EditText, com.appsbyvir.tipcalculator:id/billEditText, (), input, "56.6") : Clear the bill amount field and input '56.6' as the bill amount.
> 2. ACTION (EditText, com.appsbyvir.tipcalculator:id/tipEditText, (), input, "15") : Clear the tip percentage field, input '15' as the tip percentage, and hide the keyboard.
> 3. ASSERT (EditText, com.appsbyvir.tipcalculator:id/finalBillEditText, (), wait_until_text_presence, "text:65.09") : Verify that the calculated total amount '65.09' is correctly displayed within 10 seconds.

### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, anti.tip:id/textBill, (0, 46), click, NULL): Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but rather interacts with the existing page elements, allowing editing of bill amount in the EditText widget with id "anti.tip:id/bill".
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, anti.tip:id/bill, (160, 34), click, "0.00"): Click on the bill amount field to edit. Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page, but enables value edit within the current page.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, anti.tip:id/textPeople, (0, 94), click, NULL): Clicking on this widget does not navigate to a new page but possibly triggers an action or updates within the current page layout without visible changes to the GUI elements as per the provided JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, anti.tip:id/people, (160, 82), click, "1"): Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but helps in adjusting the number of people for the bill split calculation. No new elements appear indicating direct interaction with this widget impacts the input field only.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, anti.tip:id/textPercent, (0, 142), click, "Tip Percent (%)"): Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but allows the user to update the tip percentage. No new widgets appear as a result of this action.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, anti.tip:id/percent, (160, 130), click, "15"): Click to adjust tip percentage. Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but allows for adjustment of the tip calculation within the same interface.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, anti.tip:id/tipEach, (160, 178), click, "0.00"): Click to enter or edit the tip per person amount. Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but allows editing of tip amount per person directly on this text field.
```
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, anti.tip:id/textTip, (0, 238), click, "Total Tip"): Click to focus and update the 'Total Tip' amount. No navigation to a new page, but allows for immediate input update in the 'Total Tip' field.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, anti.tip:id/tip, (160, 226), click, "0.00"): Click to modify the total tip amount. Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page but allows editing the value directly within the same layout.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, anti.tip:id/textEach, (0, 286), click, "0.00"): Clicking on this element does not navigate to a new page or change the interface significantly. It allows the user to input or view the data "Each Person Pays", but there are no new or changed elements visible in the JSON data provided.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, anti.tip:id/each, (160, 274), click, "0.00"): Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but it is likely intended for the user to input the amount each person pays in a shared billing context. No new widgets or significant changes detected between the current and next page JSON data.
```
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, anti.tip:id/total, (160, 322), click, "0.00"): Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page or show additional widgets. It likely allows editing the total amount directly in the text field.
