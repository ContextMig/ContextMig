### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, NULL, (0,24), click, NULL): Click to open the drawer. By clicking this control, the drawer opens with multiple options corresponding to different calculators, like "Tip Calculator", "Percent Calculator", "Interest Calculator", "Discount Calculator", and more. Each of these options can be interacted with separately.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Tip Calculator, (72, 38), click, NULL): Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page but changes some UI elements such as EditText boxes id "com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/billAmountET", "com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/tipPercentET", and "com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/guestNumberET", which become clickable and long clickable. This suggests the element's behaviors have been updated with the ability to input numbers.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/billAmountET, (190, 294), click, NULL): Clicking on the Bill text field which allows the user to input the bill amount. No significant changes were observed on the next page after this action as it is designed to accept user input rather than leading to a new page.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/tipPercentET, (190, 354), click, NULL): Clicking this control does not navigate to a new page, as the GUI elements stay the same. As "Tip" EditText is an editable field, clicking on it likely gives the user the ability to enter the tip percentage in the Tip Calculator.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/totalBillAmountTV, (106, 150), click, "0"): Clicking on this control navigates to the same page with no change in UI elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/totalTipTV, (213, 150), click, "0"): This action does not result in a new page. It is a control which displays the total tip calculated based on previously entered information. It is not intended to perform an action, but is used to present results to the user after calculating the tip.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Each, (4, 208), click, NULL): Click to view per person tip and bill details. There seems to be no change in GUI elements between the current and the next page after interacting with the widget.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/perPersonBillTV, (106, 212), click, "0"): Given it is clickable, it might trigger an update in the bill calculation per person. It remains unchanged and no new element is displayed on the current page after clicking.
Since there is no difference between the current page and the next page JSON after interacting with the widget, the output would be:
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/perPersonTipTV, (213,212), click, NULL): This control does not have any interaction effect observable from the JSON data. It remains on the current page without any changes. It's possible that clicking on this control may affect backend calculations, not observable here.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/tipPercentET, (190, 354), click, "0"): Click to input the tip percent. Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page but keeps you on the current page where the tip calculator is. The new UI state has no change apart from user input on this control.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/guestNumberET, (190, 414), click, "1"): Click to edit the number of guests for the bill and tip calculation. The behavior of the app remains on the current page after clicking the element. The output elements for the calculated tips, total bill and per person amounts have not changed except the guests number field with id "com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/guestNumberET".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/resetBtn, (12, 476), click, "Reset"): The Reset button is clicked to reset all the input fields back to default for the next use. There is no navigation to a new page, but all input fields are cleared and reset to default values.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/calculateBtn, (164, 476), click, "Calculate"): Clicking on this control calculates the total bill and tip amount for each person entered in the input field. Clicking on this button doesn't lead to a new page, but updates the displayed total and each person's bill and tip amount on the current page.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided source test case semantics, the current page's intentions, and the executed action sequence, we can see that the first step in the source test case is to enter a bill amount of '56.6'. The corresponding component in the target application that allows for this action is the EditText with the id 'com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/billAmountET'. Therefore, the next step in the migration would be to perform an input operation on this component. Here is the response:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/billAmountET, (190, 294), input, "56.6"): Input '56.6' as the bill amount in the target application.
~~~
### Output

Based on the provided action details, the generated UIAutomator2 code should be:

```python
d(resourceId="com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/billAmountET").set_text("56.6")
```

In this case, because we have a unique and non-empty widget ID (com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/billAmountET) so we're using it to locate the input box for bill amount and then set the value '56.6' to it.

ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, NULL, (0, 24), click, NULL): Click to open the navigation drawer. After clicking, it navigates to the navigation drawer which contains multiple menu items including Tip Calculator, Percent Calculator, Interest Calculator and more. Each menu item is clickable and opens a different calculator tool.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/billAmountET, (190, 294), click, "56.6"): The user clicked on the 'bill amount' field to enter the bill amount. The next page is the same tip calculator page with updated bill amount on which we have a reset button (id: com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/resetBtn) and calculate button (id: com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/calculateBtn).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Total, (106, 150), click, "0"): Click to calculate the total bill and tip based on the values entered in the fields of 'Bill', 'Tip percent', and '# of people'. Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but it updates the values displayed under 'Bill', 'Tip', 'Total', and 'Each'.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/totalBillAmountTV, (106, 150), click, "0"): click to view the total bill amount. No new page appears after this action, but elements in the same page are updated.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/totalTipTV, (213, 150), click, "0"): Clicking the 'totalTipTV' component with 'id: com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/totalTipTV' on the current page may likely perform a calculation or update the total tip value. The state of the next page remains similar to the current page even after interacting with this control, indicating no significant visible UI changes due to this event.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Each, (4, 208), click, "Each"): Click on text field "Each" to enter or adjust the number of people for tip calculation. There is no new page or additional widget appearing after this action. The current control enables adjustment of a value in the 'com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/guestNumberET' field.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/perPersonBillTV, (106, 212), click, "0"): Clicking this textview ("per person bill") does not navigate to a new page or make any changes to the page, which implies this control is not interactive or no new widgets appear on this page.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/perPersonTipTV, (213, 212), click, "0"): Click to update the tip per person amount. The page after clicking this control remains the same. There are no new widgets. The entered value in the 'Bill' field is '56.6' and the tip percentage is yet to be calculated.

#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, NULL, (0, 24), click, NULL) : Opens the drawer which provides a list of calculators to use, such as "Tip Calculator", "Percent Calculator", "Interest Calculator", "Discount Calculator", "Unit Price Calculator", "BMI Calculator", "Temperature Converter", "Length Converter", "Mass Converter", "Cooking Conversion".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Tip Calculator, (72, 38), click, NULL): Clicking this control, the "Tip Calculator" module is invoked. The resulting screen maintains the same structure as the current one, but different input values are calculated to bring up new figures for "Total Amount", "Per Person Bill" and "Per Person Tip" accordingly. The exact figures depend on the values of "Bill", "Tip Percent", and "# of people". For instance, if the bill amount is "56.6", tip percent is "15" and number of people is "1", respective calculations are performed and results are updated on the screen. If no action is performed on the subsequent event sequence, the screen remains the same.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/billAmountET, (190, 294), click, "56.6"): The 'Bill' input field is clicked to either view or update the bill amount. The subsequent event sequences do not lead to any changes on the page. The same TextViews and EditTexts are still present on the page with the same properties.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, 'Tip', (210, 96), click, NULL): Click on 'Tip' widget to bring up the tip details. After clicking, there is no change to a new page, but it could possibly bring up a popup menu or dialog with more options.

On clicking, no new page appears, but the total amount of bill and tip are refreshed on the same page. The updated values have ids "com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/totalBillAmountTV" and "com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/totalTipTV".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/totalBillAmountTV, (106, 150), click, "0"): Click to view total bill amount. Clicking does not navigate to a new page, but it may display additional information related to the total bill amount in a popup or dialog box. No substantial changes to the interface or displayed elements occur after clicking this element.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/totalTipTV, (213, 150), click, "0"): The action of clicking this item doesn't trigger navigation to a new page or make any immediate changes to the current page.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Each, (4, 208), click, NULL): Clicking on this control (element) triggers no visible changes in the UI elements, thus its purpose is currently undetermined.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/perPersonBillTV, (106, 212), click, "0"): Clicking this control does not alter any elements on the page or navigate to a new one.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/perPersonTipTV, (213, 212), click, "0"): Click to view the calculated tip per person. The page after clicking this control does not navigate to a new page. The state of the page remains the same with no new elements appearing.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/tipPercentET, (190, 354), click, "15"): The action calculates a tip amount of 15 percent. Interacting with this element doesn't navigate to a new page, but updates the current page to represent the new tip percentage value. The next page shows a 'Calculate' button with id "com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/calculateBtn" which can be clicked to get the final bill and tip values.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/guestNumberET, (190, 414), click, "1"): Clicking on the '# of people' element to input the number of guests for the tip calculation. This does not lead to a new screen, but modifies the value within the '# of people' field itself.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/resetBtn, (12, 476), click, "Reset"): Resetting the calculator. After clicking this control, all the calculation fields have been reset to the default values (0 or 1). The page remains the same, but the fields for 'Bill Amount', 'Tip percent' and the respective total and per person calculations have been reset.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/calculateBtn, (164, 476), click, "Calculate"): Clicking this button calculates the total bill, total tip, per person bill, and per person tip amounts based on the input values for bill, tip percent, and number of people. After clicking, the total bill amount is updated to "65.09", the total tip to "8.49", and these same values are also reflected in the per person bill and tip fields, indicating there is only one person.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/calculateBtn, (164, 476), click, "Calculate"): Calculate the total bill and tip based on the input values.
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/totalBillAmountTV, (106, 150), wait_until_text_presence, "text:65.09"): Verify that the calculated total amount '65.09' is correctly displayed.
~~~
Here is the transformed test semantic descriptions into UIAutomator2 code form. 

```python
# Action Input: Calculate the total bill and tip based on the input values.
d(resourceId="com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/calculateBtn").click()

# Assertion: Verify that the calculated total amount '65.09' is correctly displayed.
wait_times = 0 
while True:
    wait_times += 1
    assert_text = d(resourceId="com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/totalBillAmountTV").get_text()
    if assert_text == "65.09":
        break
    elif wait_times > 50:  # The maximum waiting time would be 50 seconds
        raise AssertionError('Element does not exist: resourceId="com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/totalBillAmountTV". Text: 65.09')
    sleep(1)
```

This script clicks on the button to calculate the total bill, then waits until the total amount text is present and checks if it displays the correct total amount of '65.09'. Note that there is a maximum waiting time, so that the test does not fail silently if the conditions are not met within a reasonable time frame.

ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, NULL, (0, 24), click, NULL): Purpose is to interact with the navigation drawer. Upon clicking, the navigation drawer is opened displaying different options such as Tip Calculator, Percent Calculator, and Interest Calculator etc.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Tip Calculator, (72, 38), click, NULL): Opens a tip calculator. The page after clicking this control shows a detailed tip calculator which includes "Bill Amount", "Tip Percent", "Number of People" input fields along with "Reset" and "Calculate" buttons. After calculation, the tip and total bill per person, and the total tip and total bill are displayed.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Bill, (109, 96), click, NULL): Clicking on the 'Bill' element does not result in a new page, but the values for 'Total' and 'Each' on the page are updated in response to this action. After clicking, the value for total bill amount on the page is updated to 65.09 and the value for per person bill is also updated to 65.09, it seems that this interaction is helping to calculate the total and per person bill amounts depending on the set tip percentage and number of people.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/tipPercentET, (190, 354), click, "15"): User clicks on the EditText field to enter the tip percentage. After the interaction, there is no new elements appearing on the next page, indicating that the calculator has registered the user input and the page remains the same for further actions.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Total, (4, 146), click, "Total"): Purpose: Click to display the detailed Total calculation. The current page and the next page remain the same, no new widgets appear, suggesting that the click operation does not lead to a transition to another page or bring a new component.
Based on the provided JSON data, If we interact with the ‘com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/totalBillAmountTV’ widget (which is clickable), there are no new widgets or pages being displayed after the interaction, so the interaction does not drive a GUI transition/connection. 

Considering this, the output would be something like:

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/totalBillAmountTV, (106, 150), click, "65.09"): No new widgets or pages appear after this interaction.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/totalTipTV, (213, 150), click, "8.49"): Clicking on this widget does not navigate to a new page, but the data displayed on the page remains same. The purpose could be observing or checking the tip amount calculated by the 'Tip Calculator'.

Based on the source test case semantics, the current page's intentions, and the executed action sequence, it seems that all steps of the source test case have been successfully migrated to the target application.

The source test case has the following steps:
1. Input '56.6' as the bill amount.
2. Input '15' as the tip percentage.
3. Verify that the calculated total amount '65.09' is correctly displayed.

The executed action sequence in the target application includes all these steps:
1. Input '56.6' as the bill amount - ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/billAmountET, (190, 294), input, "56.6")
2. Input '15' as the tip percentage - ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/tipPercentET, (190, 354), input, "15")
3. Calculate the total bill and tip based on the input values - ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/calculateBtn, (164, 476), click, "Calculate")
4. Verify that the calculated total amount '65.09' is correctly displayed - ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/totalBillAmountTV, (106, 150), wait_until_text_presence, "text:65.09")

Therefore, the migration of the test case from the source application to the target application is complete.
