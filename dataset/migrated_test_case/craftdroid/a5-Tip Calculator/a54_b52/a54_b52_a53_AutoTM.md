### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Simple Tip Calculator, (16, 39), click, NULL): The Simple Tip Calculator control is clicked to calculate tips. Afterwards, the GUI elements don't significantly change between the current page and the next page, indicating that the click operation doesn't introduce a new widget or navigate to a new page, but it may trigger certain background processing.
ACTION (android.view.View, Advertisement, (10, 96), click, NULL): Clicking on the Advertisement triggers the ad for user engagement. The page remains the same after the action and new widgets do not appear.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Test Ad, (129, 96), click, NULL): Click on the 'Test Ad' widget. After this interaction, no new page appears nor any new widget.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/editTextBill, (150, 166), click, "100.00"): User clicks on the 'Bill' field to enter the bill amount. After clicking on it, the current page remains the same allowing for user input.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/editTextBill, (150,166), click, "100.00"): Click to edit the total bill amount. After clicking this control, the same page remains open with no changes in the GUI elements. Therefore, this action potentially opens the keyboard for the user to input the new bill amount.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/editTextTip, (225, 216), click, "15"): Modify the tip percentage. Click on this control does not navigate to a new page but allows to edit the percentage of tip on the bill. The pages before and after clicking this control are identical, with the same list of components. This means that the exact result of clicking this control entirely depends on the user's input.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/buttonTipMinus, (150, 216), click, "-"): Click to decrease the tip percentage. After clicking, the tip percent value in the EditText with the id "com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/editTextTip" decreases by 1%.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/buttonTipPlus, (190, 216), click, "+"): The '+' button is clicked to increase the tip percentage. After clicking, the tip percentage in the EditText with id "com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/editTextTip" increases by 1, changing from "15" to "16".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/buttonSplitMinus, (150, 266), click, "-"): A click on this control changes the 'Split' value in the current page. The change in value signifies the number of people the total bill will be divided amongst. No new pages or widgets appear after interaction.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/buttonSplitPlus, (190, 266), click, "+"): This action increases the split amount on 'Simple Tip Calculator'. After clicking, the split value in the input field with ID "com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/editTextSplit" is incremented from '1' to '2'.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/editTextSplit, (225, 266), click, "1"): The click interaction with this 'Split' element presumably triggers an on-screen keyboard for the input of a numeric/string value. After interaction, no new screen appears but the GUI remains same, suggesting that interaction might lead to user-entered changes on this screen itself, such as inputting a specific split value for bill calculation.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/buttonCalculate, (23, 317), click, "Calculate"): Click to calculate the tip. After this control is clicked, the Total Bill on the next page is updated to "$115.00", Total Tip becomes "$15.00", and per person payment also becomes "$115.00".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/buttonShare, (116, 317), click, "Share"): Click on this control to share the calculated tip and bill details. Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but it enables the sharing functionality of the app.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/buttonCopyResult, (209, 317), click, "Copy"): Click to copy the result. No change in GUI elements of the next page was observed after the button click, indicating that the result might have copied to the clipboard.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Total Bill, (16, 396), click, NULL): Click on this control does not navigate to a new page, but changes are made in the current page. The text value of "Total Bill" which was "$0.00" before has now changed.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/textViewTotalToPay, (170, 396), click, "$0.00"): Click to view the total amount to pay. Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but the amount displayed may change based on modifications made in the calculator.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/textViewTotalTip, (168, 428), click, "$0.00"): Click to view the total tip. Clicking does not navigate to a new page, but can update the displayed total tip amount based on the other input fields (bill amount, tip percentage, split number).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Per person, [16, 460], unclickable, 'Per person'): This control allows user to view the total split payment per person. No direct user interaction is possible as it is not clickable. After clicking the Calculate button, this TextView field displays updated data on split payments per person.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/textViewTotalPerPerson, (178, 460), click, "$0.00"): Click to display the total per person. Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page or display new elements.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/editTextTip, (225, 216), input, "15"): Clear the existing value and input '15' as the tip percentage.
~~~
### Output:

To achieve the desired action through UIAutomator2 code, you could use the following code snippet:

```python
d(resourceId="com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/editTextTip").clear_text()
d(resourceId="com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/editTextTip").set_text("15")
```

In the code above, we first clear the existing text in the EditText field denoted by the given `resourceId`. After that, we set the text as "15". Note that we don't use coordinates to locate the widget and set its text. We use the `resourceId`, as the `input` action indicates that we can use it when the id is unique and non-empty.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/textViewTotalPerPerson, (176, 460), wait_until_text_presence, "text:16.27"): Verify that the 'per person bill' text view displays '16.27' within 10 seconds after calculation.

### Output(The code should be wrapped using '···'):

'''python
from time import time, sleep

start_time = time()
while time() - start_time < 10:
    text = d(resourceId="com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/textViewTotalPerPerson").get_text()
    if text == '16.27':
        break
    sleep(1)

assert text == '16.27', "The 'per person bill' text view doesn't display '16.27' within 10 seconds after calculation."
'''

The code block above will first declare a `start_time` using Python's built-in `time()` function, then it enters a loop. Inside the loop, the text of the TextView with the given resourceId is retrieved. If the text is the expected value ('16.27'), the loop will break. However, if the text does not equal the expected value, the loop will sleep for 1 second before the start of the next iteration. This loop will continue until 10 seconds have passed since the `start_time`. After the loop, an assert statement checks if the text equals the expected value and will raise an AssertionError with the appropriate error message if it doesn't.
