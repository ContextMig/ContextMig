### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, NULL, (0,24), click, NULL): Click to open the drawer. By clicking this control, the drawer opens with multiple options corresponding to different calculators, like "Tip Calculator", "Percent Calculator", "Interest Calculator", "Discount Calculator", and more. Each of these options can be interacted with separately.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Tip Calculator, (72, 38), click, NULL): Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page but changes some UI elements such as EditText boxes id "com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/billAmountET", "com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/tipPercentET", and "com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/guestNumberET", which become clickable and long clickable. This suggests the element's behaviors have been updated with the ability to input numbers.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/billAmountET, (190, 294), click, NULL): Clicking on the Bill text field which allows the user to input the bill amount. No significant changes were observed on the next page after this action as it is designed to accept user input rather than leading to a new page.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/tipPercentET, (190, 354), click, NULL): Clicking this control does not navigate to a new page, as the GUI elements stay the same. As "Tip" EditText is an editable field, clicking on it likely gives the user the ability to enter the tip percentage in the Tip Calculator.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/totalBillAmountTV, (106, 150), click, "0"): Clicking on this control navigates to the same page with no change in UI elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/totalTipTV, (213, 150), click, "0"): This action does not result in a new page. It is a control which displays the total tip calculated based on previously entered information. It is not intended to perform an action, but is used to present results to the user after calculating the tip.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Each, (4, 208), click, NULL): Click to view per person tip and bill details. There seems to be no change in GUI elements between the current and the next page after interacting with the widget.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/perPersonBillTV, (106, 212), click, "0"): Given it is clickable, it might trigger an update in the bill calculation per person. It remains unchanged and no new element is displayed on the current page after clicking.
Since there is no difference between the current page and the next page JSON after interacting with the widget, the output would be:
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/perPersonTipTV, (213,212), click, NULL): This control does not have any interaction effect observable from the JSON data. It remains on the current page without any changes. It's possible that clicking on this control may affect backend calculations, not observable here.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/tipPercentET, (190, 354), click, "0"): Click to input the tip percent. Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page but keeps you on the current page where the tip calculator is. The new UI state has no change apart from user input on this control.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/guestNumberET, (190, 414), click, "1"): Click to edit the number of guests for the bill and tip calculation. The behavior of the app remains on the current page after clicking the element. The output elements for the calculated tips, total bill and per person amounts have not changed except the guests number field with id "com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/guestNumberET".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/resetBtn, (12, 476), click, "Reset"): The Reset button is clicked to reset all the input fields back to default for the next use. There is no navigation to a new page, but all input fields are cleared and reset to default values.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/calculateBtn, (164, 476), click, "Calculate"): Clicking on this control calculates the total bill and tip amount for each person entered in the input field. Clicking on this button doesn't lead to a new page, but updates the displayed total and each person's bill and tip amount on the current page.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, the first step in the source test case is to click on the 'Accept' button to proceed. However, there is no such button in the current page's intentions. As such, we can consider this step as irrelevant for the target application and proceed to the next step.

The second step in the source test case is to clear the bill amount field and input "56.6" as the new bill amount. From the current page's intentions, we can see that there is an 'EditText' element with id 'com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/billAmountET' that allows for user input of the bill amount. This matches the purpose of the second step in the source test case.

Therefore, the next step in the test case migration would be to interact with the 'EditText' element to input the bill amount. Here is the corresponding action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/billAmountET, (190, 294), input, "56.6"): Input "56.6" into the bill amount field.
~~~
#### Output:

The output for this action can be translated into the following Python uiautomator2 code snippit:

```python
d(resourceId="com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/billAmountET").set_text("56.6")
```

This uses the unique widget ID `com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/billAmountET` to precisely locate the INPUT field, and then `set_text()` method is used to input "56.6" into the field.

Based on the provided source test case semantics, current page's intentions, and executed action sequence, it seems like we have already successfully migrated steps 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the source test case to the target app. 

The next step in the source test case is to verify that the 'Total Per Person' text view displays "$16.27" within 10 seconds, confirming the correct calculation based on the input values. 

To achieve this, we should assert the text of 'perPersonBillTV' TextView in the target app. Here is the next step of the migration:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/perPersonBillTV, (106, 212), wait_until_text_presence, "16.27"): Verify that the 'Total Per Person' text view displays "$16.27" within 10 seconds, confirming the correct calculation based on the input values.

Since there are no actions given, there will be no UIAutomator2 code generated. If there were any actions, the process would involve transforming the actions from the semantic description into Python code using UIAutomator2. To elaborate, if an action involves clicking on an element with specific coordinates or ID, the generated code would include a command such as `d.click(x, y)` or `d(resourceId="id").click()`. 

Please provide actions input for conversion to UIAutomator2 code.
