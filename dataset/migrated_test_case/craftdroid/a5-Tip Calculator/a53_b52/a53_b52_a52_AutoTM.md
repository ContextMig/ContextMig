### Semantics of Source Test case
> This test case is designed to validate the functionality of a simple tip calculator application by inputting bill amount, tip percentage, and split count, then verifying the calculated total per person.
> 
> The detailed process with serial numbers is as follows:
> 
> 1. ACTION (Button, android:id/button1, (), click, NULL) : Click on the 'Accept' button to proceed.
> 2. ACTION (EditText, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/editTextBill, (), input, "56.6") : Clear the bill amount field and input "56.6" as the new bill amount.
> 3. ACTION (EditText, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/editTextTip, (), input, "15") : Clear the tip percentage field and input "15" as the tip percentage.
> 4. ACTION (EditText, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/editTextSplit, (), input, "4") : Clear the split count field, input "4" as the number of splits, and hide the keyboard.
> 5. ACTION (Button, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/buttonCalculate, (), click, NULL) : Click on the 'Calculate' button to perform the calculation.
> 6. ASSERT (TextView, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/textViewTotalPerPerson, (), wait_until_text_presence, "text:16.27") : Verify that the 'Total Per Person' text view displays "$16.27" within 10 seconds, confirming the correct calculation based on the input values.

### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (16, 276), click, "Connect to internet and enjoy more wonderful FREE games!"): Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but offers options to 'Skip' or 'Connect' to internet services, each having buttons with ids "android:id/button2" and "android:id/button1" respectively.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (16, 339), click, "Skip"): Click to skip the connection step. The resulting page includes a Tip Calculator with fields for Bill amount, Tip percentage, Split information, and final calculation details.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (160, 339), click, "Connect"): Click to attempt a connection to the internet. No new page appears or no new widgets are displayed after the action.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (16, 339), click, NULL): Click to skip the connection step and proceed to the Tip Calculator page.
~~~
Based on the parameters received, the Uiautomator2 Python code for the action would be:

```python
d.click(16, 339)
```
Since the coordinates are precise and no value is to be inputted, the click operations is performed using the coordinates provided.

Based on the source test case semantics, current page's intent, and executed action sequence, the next step of the test migration is to perform the calculation. In the source app, this was achieved by clicking a 'Calculate' button. However, in the target app, it seems no explicit 'Calculate' button exists. The calculation might be performed automatically after the input of 'bill amount', 'tip percentage', and 'split count'. Thus, the next step is to assert the calculated 'Per Person' amount.

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.EditText, com.appsbyvir.tipcalculator:id/perPersonEditText, (178, 453), wait_until_text_presence, "16.27"): Verify that the 'Per Person' text view displays "16.27" within 10 seconds, confirming the correct calculation based on the input values.
~~~
Based on your requirements and your provided actions, it would transform the received semantic representation into uiautomator2 code. Here is the conversion for your input:

```python
import time

start_time = time.time()

# Wait until the desired text appears or timeout
while True:
    current_text = d(resourceId="com.appsbyvir.tipcalculator:id/perPersonEditText").get_text()
    if current_text == "16.27":
        break

    if time.time() - start_time > 10:
        assert False, "Timeout! Desired text did not appear in widget within 10 seconds"
```

This code snippet will help you confirm if the 'Per Person' text view displays "16.27" within 10 seconds, therefore verifying that the calculation based on the input values is correct.

Based on the source test case semantics and the sequence of actions already executed on the target app, it appears we have successfully migrated all the steps from the source test case to the target app. The actions performed on the target app align with the source test case's steps, and each action's execution was successful as per the execution states.

The last step performed on the target app was to click on the 'Final Bill: Verified by Vir' TextView, which acknowledges the final bill calculation. This step aligns with the purpose of the 'Calculate' button click in the source test case, which performs the calculation. 

Since all the steps of the source test case have been successfully migrated and executed on the target app, we can conclude the test case migration.
