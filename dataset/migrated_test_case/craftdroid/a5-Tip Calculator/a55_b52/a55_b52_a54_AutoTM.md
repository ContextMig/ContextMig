### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, NULL, (0,24), click, NULL): Click to open the drawer. By clicking this control, the drawer opens with multiple options corresponding to different calculators, like "Tip Calculator", "Percent Calculator", "Interest Calculator", "Discount Calculator", and more. Each of these options can be interacted with separately.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Tip Calculator, (72, 38), click, NULL): Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page but changes some UI elements such as EditText boxes id "com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/billAmountET", "com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/tipPercentET", and "com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/guestNumberET", which become clickable and long clickable. This suggests the element's behaviors have been updated with the ability to input numbers.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/billAmountET, (190, 294), click, NULL): Clicking on the Bill text field which allows the user to input the bill amount. No significant changes were observed on the next page after this action as it is designed to accept user input rather than leading to a new page.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/tipPercentET, (190, 354), click, NULL): Clicking this control does not navigate to a new page, as the GUI elements stay the same. As "Tip" EditText is an editable field, clicking on it likely gives the user the ability to enter the tip percentage in the Tip Calculator.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/totalBillAmountTV, (106, 150), click, "0"): Clicking on this control navigates to the same page with no change in UI elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/totalTipTV, (213, 150), click, "0"): This action does not result in a new page. It is a control which displays the total tip calculated based on previously entered information. It is not intended to perform an action, but is used to present results to the user after calculating the tip.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Each, (4, 208), click, NULL): Click to view per person tip and bill details. There seems to be no change in GUI elements between the current and the next page after interacting with the widget.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/perPersonBillTV, (106, 212), click, "0"): Given it is clickable, it might trigger an update in the bill calculation per person. It remains unchanged and no new element is displayed on the current page after clicking.
Since there is no difference between the current page and the next page JSON after interacting with the widget, the output would be:
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/perPersonTipTV, (213,212), click, NULL): This control does not have any interaction effect observable from the JSON data. It remains on the current page without any changes. It's possible that clicking on this control may affect backend calculations, not observable here.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/tipPercentET, (190, 354), click, "0"): Click to input the tip percent. Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page but keeps you on the current page where the tip calculator is. The new UI state has no change apart from user input on this control.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/guestNumberET, (190, 414), click, "1"): Click to edit the number of guests for the bill and tip calculation. The behavior of the app remains on the current page after clicking the element. The output elements for the calculated tips, total bill and per person amounts have not changed except the guests number field with id "com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/guestNumberET".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/resetBtn, (12, 476), click, "Reset"): The Reset button is clicked to reset all the input fields back to default for the next use. There is no navigation to a new page, but all input fields are cleared and reset to default values.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/calculateBtn, (164, 476), click, "Calculate"): Clicking on this control calculates the total bill and tip amount for each person entered in the input field. Clicking on this button doesn't lead to a new page, but updates the displayed total and each person's bill and tip amount on the current page.

ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, NULL, (0, 24), click, NULL) : Opens the drawer which provides a list of calculators to use, such as "Tip Calculator", "Percent Calculator", "Interest Calculator", "Discount Calculator", "Unit Price Calculator", "BMI Calculator", "Temperature Converter", "Length Converter", "Mass Converter", "Cooking Conversion".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Tip Calculator, (72, 38), click, NULL): Clicking this control, the "Tip Calculator" module is invoked. The resulting screen maintains the same structure as the current one, but different input values are calculated to bring up new figures for "Total Amount", "Per Person Bill" and "Per Person Tip" accordingly. The exact figures depend on the values of "Bill", "Tip Percent", and "# of people". For instance, if the bill amount is "56.6", tip percent is "15" and number of people is "1", respective calculations are performed and results are updated on the screen. If no action is performed on the subsequent event sequence, the screen remains the same.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/billAmountET, (190, 294), click, "56.6"): The 'Bill' input field is clicked to either view or update the bill amount. The subsequent event sequences do not lead to any changes on the page. The same TextViews and EditTexts are still present on the page with the same properties.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, 'Tip', (210, 96), click, NULL): Click on 'Tip' widget to bring up the tip details. After clicking, there is no change to a new page, but it could possibly bring up a popup menu or dialog with more options.

On clicking, no new page appears, but the total amount of bill and tip are refreshed on the same page. The updated values have ids "com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/totalBillAmountTV" and "com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/totalTipTV".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/totalBillAmountTV, (106, 150), click, "0"): Click to view total bill amount. Clicking does not navigate to a new page, but it may display additional information related to the total bill amount in a popup or dialog box. No substantial changes to the interface or displayed elements occur after clicking this element.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/totalTipTV, (213, 150), click, "0"): The action of clicking this item doesn't trigger navigation to a new page or make any immediate changes to the current page.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Each, (4, 208), click, NULL): Clicking on this control (element) triggers no visible changes in the UI elements, thus its purpose is currently undetermined.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/perPersonBillTV, (106, 212), click, "0"): Clicking this control does not alter any elements on the page or navigate to a new one.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/perPersonTipTV, (213, 212), click, "0"): Click to view the calculated tip per person. The page after clicking this control does not navigate to a new page. The state of the page remains the same with no new elements appearing.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/tipPercentET, (190, 354), click, "15"): The action calculates a tip amount of 15 percent. Interacting with this element doesn't navigate to a new page, but updates the current page to represent the new tip percentage value. The next page shows a 'Calculate' button with id "com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/calculateBtn" which can be clicked to get the final bill and tip values.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/guestNumberET, (190, 414), click, "1"): Clicking on the '# of people' element to input the number of guests for the tip calculation. This does not lead to a new screen, but modifies the value within the '# of people' field itself.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/resetBtn, (12, 476), click, "Reset"): Resetting the calculator. After clicking this control, all the calculation fields have been reset to the default values (0 or 1). The page remains the same, but the fields for 'Bill Amount', 'Tip percent' and the respective total and per person calculations have been reset.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/calculateBtn, (164, 476), click, "Calculate"): Clicking this button calculates the total bill, total tip, per person bill, and per person tip amounts based on the input values for bill, tip percent, and number of people. After clicking, the total bill amount is updated to "65.09", the total tip to "8.49", and these same values are also reflected in the per person bill and tip fields, indicating there is only one person.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence, the next step in the source test case to be migrated is step 3. The action is to input the number of people as "4" into the corresponding field. From the current page's intentions, the corresponding field in the target app is the '# of people' field with the id 'com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/guestNumberET'. 

So, the next step for test case migration is to input "4" into the '# of people' field in the target app.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/guestNumberET, (190, 414), input, "4"): Input the number of people as "4" into the corresponding field.
~~~
Based on the Actions input provided, the conversion to UIAutomator2 code in Python should look like this:

### Output:
```python
d(resourceId="com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/guestNumberET").set_text("4")
```

In this case, since we have a unique widget id available (com.zaidisoft.teninone:id/guestNumberET), we are using it with `set_text()` method to input the number "4". Applying coordinate-based positioning isn't necessary in this case as the widget id is distinct and will deliver the job more effectively. Thus, we use `set_text()` method to enter the number "4" into the corresponding field of the EditText widget.
