### Semantics of Source Test case
> ```
> This test case is testing the functionality of a tip calculator that calculates the total amount including tip based on the bill amount and tip percentage entered by the user, and verifying the calculated total amount.
> 
> The detailed process with serial numbers is as follows:
> 
> 1. ACTION (EditText, anti.tip:id/bill, (), input, "56.6") : Clear the existing value and input '56.6' as the bill amount.
> 2. ACTION (EditText, anti.tip:id/percent, (), input, "15") : Clear the existing tip percentage and input '15', then hide the keyboard.
> 3. ASSERT (EditText, anti.tip:id/total, (), wait_until_text_presence, "text:65.09") : Verify that the total amount calculated and displayed is '65.09' within 10 seconds.

#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Tip Calculator, (16, 38), click, NULL): The "Tip Calculator" has been clicked. No new page or widgets appear. Therefore, the purpose is to initiate the tip calculation process.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/share_tip_info, (224, 28), click, NULL): Clicking the "share_tip_info" widget opens the sharing options for tip information. The next page does not have any widgets, implying that the interface opened may be an external share prompt (like system's share options), outside of the scope of current app and cannot be captured by JSON data.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, No ID, (280, 28), click, NULL): Accessing the more options menu. Clicking this control opens a dropdown menu that contains options for Community, Share App, Rate App, and Blog.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Enter Bill Info Below!, (78, 96), click, NULL): Clicking on this Widget ID does not navigate to a new page and does not result in the appearance of new widgets or dialogs. It can be inferred that this control may not have a significant function or it could be a label for user instruction.

No new page appears after this action. The subsequent user interactions may include entering a number into the text field of this widget.
Based on the given information, it isn't clear which widget should be interacted with in this test case. The widget ID and Control ID have been marked as "Tip", which doesn't provide enough information to generate a formal response.

Please provide more details, such as the specific operation conducted on the widget, the widget's ID, its type, the other attributes of it, and details about how it changes from the current page to the next page. This would then enable generating a corresponding action, detailing specific changes, and the purpose of the interaction.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/btCalculate, (60, 386), click, "Calculate"): Clicking on this control performs the calculation of the bill. After clicking, there is no change in page, thus indicating same elements' visibility as the current page; no new elements/widgets appear.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/etTipAmount, (104, 165), click, "15"): Click to modify the tip amount. The next page remains the same because this control is for text entry, not navigation. User can potentially change the tip amount, impacting final calculation results.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/etBillTotal, (104, 211), click, "56.6"): Clicking on this control is to allow the user to input the bill total in the field.

ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/btReset, (60, 434), click, 'Reset'): To reset all input fields and calculated values. After the action, all values on the page are reset.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/tvTipTotal, (97, 282), click, "$ 0.15"): Click on this item to view the total tip amount. Since no differences between next page JSON and current page JSON are detected, the click action doesn't lead to another page or open new widgets.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/tvTotalWithTip, (110, 315), click, "$ 1.15"): Click to possibly refresh or recalculate the total amount with tip. In the next page, no new page appears and no new widgets are generated after clicking.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView,com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/tvTotalWithTip, (110,315), clickable, "$ 1.15"): Click to possibly share or open more options regarding the total amount with tip. The state of the app and the available widgets remain the same after the interaction.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/tvPersonPay, (136, 348), click, "$ 1.15"): Updates the "Each Person Pays" field to the calculated value based on the number of persons, tip percentage, and bill total inputted and clicking the 'Calculate' button.

ACTION (android.view.View, NULL, (280, 487), click, NULL): This interaction brings up a pop-up or interaction on the same page but doesn't navigate to a new one. The widget description is "صحيفة مال" meaning there could be some information or functionality related to this that appears upon interaction. However, it's unclear what specific change this action triggers without more information.
ACTION (android.view.View, NULL, (108, 498), click, NULL): Click to view information about Vision 2030. This action does not navigate to a new page, the current page remains the same.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/btCalculate, (60, 386), click, NULL): After entering the bill amount and tip percentage, click the calculate button to perform the calculation.
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/tvTotalWithTip, (110, 315), wait_until_text_presence, "text:$ 65.09"): Re-verify that the total amount calculated and displayed is '$ 65.09' within 10 seconds.
~~~
### Converting your input of Actions into uiautomator2 python code gives the following output:

···
d.click(60, 386)
assert d(resourceId="com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/tvTotalWithTip").wait(timeout=10.0).get_text() == "text:$ 65.09"
···

In this code, we are performing a click action at the coordinates (60, 386) which corresponds to the calculate button as specified in your input. Then, we verify the total amount calculated is '$ 65.09'. We are using the `wait` method to wait for the 'tvTotalWithTip' TextView to be present before we try to extract the text from it.
