### Semantics of Source Test case
> ```
> This test case is testing the functionality of a tip calculator that calculates the total amount including tip based on the bill amount and tip percentage entered by the user, and verifying the calculated total amount.
> 
> The detailed process with serial numbers is as follows:
> 
> 1. ACTION (EditText, anti.tip:id/bill, (), input, "56.6") : Clear the existing value and input '56.6' as the bill amount.
> 2. ACTION (EditText, anti.tip:id/percent, (), input, "15") : Clear the existing tip percentage and input '15', then hide the keyboard.
> 3. ASSERT (EditText, anti.tip:id/total, (), wait_until_text_presence, "text:65.09") : Verify that the total amount calculated and displayed is '65.09' within 10 seconds.
> ```

### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Simple Tip Calculator, (16, 39), click, NULL): The Simple Tip Calculator control is clicked to calculate tips. Afterwards, the GUI elements don't significantly change between the current page and the next page, indicating that the click operation doesn't introduce a new widget or navigate to a new page, but it may trigger certain background processing.
ACTION (android.view.View, "", (10, 96), click, NULL): The advertisement banner in the calculator app was clicked. After clicking on the advertisement, the banner's description changes to "Open MAUHK MAUHK Clothing ".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Test Ad, (129, 96), click, NULL): Click on the 'Test Ad' widget. After this interaction, no new page appears nor any new widget.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/editTextBill, (150, 166), click, "100.00"): User clicks on the 'Bill' field to enter the bill amount. After clicking on it, the current page remains the same allowing for user input.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/editTextBill, (150,166), click, "100.00"): Click to edit the total bill amount. After clicking this control, the same page remains open with no changes in the GUI elements. Therefore, this action potentially opens the keyboard for the user to input the new bill amount.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/editTextTip, (225, 216), click, "15"): Modify the tip percentage. Click on this control does not navigate to a new page but allows to edit the percentage of tip on the bill. The pages before and after clicking this control are identical, with the same list of components. This means that the exact result of clicking this control entirely depends on the user's input.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/buttonTipMinus, (150, 216), click, "-"): Click to decrease the tip percentage. After clicking, the tip percent value in the EditText with the id "com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/editTextTip" decreases by 1%.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/buttonTipPlus, (190, 216), click, "+"): The '+' button is clicked to increase the tip percentage. After clicking, the tip percentage in the EditText with id "com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/editTextTip" increases by 1, changing from "15" to "16".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/buttonSplitMinus, (150, 266), click, "-"): A click on this control changes the 'Split' value in the current page. The change in value signifies the number of people the total bill will be divided amongst. No new pages or widgets appear after interaction.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/buttonSplitPlus, (190, 266), click, "+"): This action increases the split amount on 'Simple Tip Calculator'. After clicking, the split value in the input field with ID "com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/editTextSplit" is incremented from '1' to '2'.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/editTextSplit, (225, 266), click, "1"): The click interaction with this 'Split' element presumably triggers an on-screen keyboard for the input of a numeric/string value.

ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/buttonCalculate, (23, 317), click, "Calculate"): Click to calculate the tip. After this control is clicked, the Total Bill on the next page is updated to "$115.00", Total Tip becomes "$15.00", and per person payment also becomes "$115.00".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/buttonShare, (116, 317), click, "Share"): Click on this control to share the calculated tip and bill details. Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but it enables the sharing functionality of the app.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Total Bill, (16, 396), click, NULL): Clicking on this control does not navigate to any new page or bring up dialog/pop-up. The next sequence of control interactions remains the same as before the click action was performed on this widget. No new widgets or elements appear.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/textViewTotalToPay, (170, 396), click, "$0.00"): Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page or make any visible changes.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/textViewTotalTip, (168, 428), click, "$0.00"): Clicking on this 'Total Tip' field does not navigate to a new page but changes the text field of "Total Tip" from "$0.00" to "$15.00" corresponding to a 15% tip calculation on the bill entered.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.tleapps.simpletipcalculator:id/textViewTotalPerPerson, (178, 460), click, "$0.00"): Click to view per person bill. No new page appears but the view is refreshed showing the calculated split of total bill per person.
