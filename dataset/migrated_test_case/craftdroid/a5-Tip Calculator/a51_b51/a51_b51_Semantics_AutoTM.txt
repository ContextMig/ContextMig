This test case is testing the functionality of a tip calculator that calculates the total amount including tip based on the bill amount and tip percentage entered by the user, and verifying the calculated total amount.

The detailed process with serial numbers is as follows:

1. ACTION (EditText, anti.tip:id/bill, (), input, "56.6") : Clear the existing value and input '56.6' as the bill amount.
2. ACTION (EditText, anti.tip:id/percent, (), input, "15") : Clear the existing tip percentage and input '15', then hide the keyboard.
3. ASSERT (EditText, anti.tip:id/total, (), wait_until_text_presence, "text:65.09") : Verify that the total amount calculated and displayed is '65.09' within 10 seconds.
