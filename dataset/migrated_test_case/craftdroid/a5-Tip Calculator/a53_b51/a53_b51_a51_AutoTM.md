### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, anti.tip:id/textBill, (0, 46), click, "Bill Amount"): Clicking on this control allows the user to interact with or modify the bill amount. Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page but maintains the current interface for editing financial details directly.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, anti.tip:id/bill, (160, 34), click, "0.00"): Click to activate and edit the bill amount. No navigation to a new page occurs, but enables text input for updating the bill amount directly on the current page.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, anti.tip:id/textPeople, (0, 94), click, NULL): Clicking on this widget does not navigate to a new page or reveal new widgets.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, anti.tip:id/people, (160, 82), click, "1"): Click to modify the number of people sharing the tip. Interaction does not change the page, maintaining context for input adjustment.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, anti.tip:id/textPercent, (0, 142), click, "Tip Percent (%)"): Clicking on this control allows adjustment of the tip percentage. No new page appears but potentially updates related tip calculation fields on the current page.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, anti.tip:id/percent, (160, 130), click, "15"): Clicking on this control allows for adjusting the tip percentage. However, interacting with it doesn't navigate to a new page but potentially updates calculations within the current page context, such as "Tip Per Person", "Total Tip", and "Each Person Pays" values, provided these elements dynamically change based on the tip percentage input.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, anti.tip:id/textTipEach, (0, 190), click, NULL): Click to view details about 'Tip Per Person'. Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page, but allows interaction with the corresponding editable field for entering individual tips. No new elements appear, indicating static interaction within the same screen context.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, anti.tip:id/tipEach, (160, 178), click, "0.00"): Click to change the tip per person. Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page, but the values of the editable fields are recalculated related to the bill amount, number of people, and tip percentage.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, anti.tip:id/textTip, (0, 238), click, "0.00"): Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but allows the user to input the total tip directly. No new elements or significant changes detected in the next page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, anti.tip:id/tip, (160, 226), click, "0.00"): Click to modify or add a tip amount. No change to the navigation page, all inputs including bill amount, number of people, tip percent, and payments details remain editable post-click.
```
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, anti.tip:id/each, (160, 274), click, "0.00"): Click to edit the value for each person pays. Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but allows for text entry in the field.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, anti.tip:id/textTotal, (0, 334), click, "Total Amount"): Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page but allows updating the total amount directly on the current page.
```
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, anti.tip:id/total, (160, 322), click, "0.00"): Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but potentially allows updating the "Total Amount" value within the same page.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information and considering that no actions have been executed yet on the target application, the first step in the source test case is to click on the 'Accept' button to proceed with the default settings or values. However, the current page's intentions do not list an 'Accept' button or a similar functionality. Therefore, it seems like this step might not have a direct equivalent in the target application or might not be necessary due to differences in application design and flow.

Given the absence of a matching action for the 'Accept' button and the focus on migrating the functional aspects of the test case, the next logical step would be to start with the bill amount entry, which is the first action in the source test case that directly interacts with the application's core functionality.

The closest matching action for entering the bill amount in the target application is:

```
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, anti.tip:id/bill, (160, 34), click, "0.00"): Click to activate and edit the bill amount.
```

To align with the source test case step 2, which involves clearing the bill amount field and inputting the value '56.6', the corresponding action in the target application would be to click on the bill amount field and input '56.6'. Since the action description for inputting text was not explicitly provided, I will use 'input' as the action for text entry based on common practices.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, anti.tip:id/bill, (160, 34), input, "56.6"): Clear the bill amount field and input the value '56.6'.
~~~
Certainly, based on the given instructions for the actions, the UIAutomator2 code in Python would be as follows:

```python
d.click(160, 34)
d(resourceId="anti.tip:id/bill").set_text("56.6")
```
