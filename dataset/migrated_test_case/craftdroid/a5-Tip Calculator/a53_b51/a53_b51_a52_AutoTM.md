#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the source test case and the actions that have already been executed in the target application, the next logical step in the migration process is to perform the calculation of the total amount to be paid, as that's what follows after entering the bill and tip values in the source application.

From the given intentions of the current page, the action that corresponds to performing the calculation can be identified as:

```
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.appsbyvir.tipcalculator:id/finalTextView, (17, 420), click, "Total: 65.09"): Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but confirms the total amount to be paid calculated by the app, including tips, as verified by Vir.
```

This action seems to be the one that triggers the display of the calculated total, which aligns with the next step in the source test case where the 'Calculate' button is clicked to compute the total amount. Although it's not an exact match in terms of UI element (Button vs TextView), functionally, it serves the same purpose of finalizing and displaying the calculation.

Thus, the next action to be executed in the migration process would be:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.appsbyvir.tipcalculator:id/finalTextView, (17, 420), click, NULL): Click to confirm the total amount to be paid.
~~~

This action should advance the test case migration by simulating the calculation step in the source application within the operational logic of the target application. Once this action is successfully executed, it would be appropriate to verify the total amount displayed, as per the source test case step 5. However, since the focus is on one step at a time, the verification would be considered in the subsequent interaction.
