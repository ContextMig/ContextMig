#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, the first step of the test migration corresponds to the action of clicking the 'Accept' button in the source app. However, in the current page's intentions, there is no corresponding action. Therefore, we can consider skipping this step and matching the next step.

The second step in the source test case is the input of the bill amount. The corresponding operation in the target application can be found in the current page's intentions, which is to click on the EditText with id 'com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/etBillTotal' to input the bill total. 

So, the next step of the test migration should be to perform this operation. Here is the output:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/etBillTotal, (104, 211), input, "56.6"): Input the bill amount '56.6' into the 'Bill Total' field.
~~~
Based on the given input and instructions, you're trying to input text into a field. Since you prefer using widget id for text input, here is the respective Python code for UIAutomator2:

```python
d(resourceId="com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/etBillTotal").set_text("56.6")
```

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/tvTotalWithTip, (110, 315), click, "$ 1.15"): Click on the 'Total with Tip' control to outline the total tip amount. The total amount value remains unchanged when compared to the next page received from JSON data.
Based on the provided information, no interaction with the stated widget was identified in both the Current Page JSON and the Next Page JSON. Also, the widget `Each Person Pays:` does not seem to have the control of `clickable`. Thus, we cannot generate any action as there is no noticeable change. Can you please verify if the provided details for the widget ID and its control are correct? The details in the JSON data for the current and next pages must reflect the interaction with the widget.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/tvPersonPay, (136, 348), click, "$ 1.15"): Clicking on this widget does not lead to a new page or bring up any new widgets.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/btReset, (60,434), click, "Reset"): Reset the bill, tip, and person details on the page. The following information will be reset on the screen: 'Persons' input text with id 'com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/etPerson', 'Tip' input text with id 'com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/etTipAmount', and 'Bill Total' input text with id 'com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/etBillTotal'. This reset action will also impact the related calculated fields like 'Tip Amount', 'Total with Tip' and 'Each Person Pays' values on the screen.
ACTION (android.view.View, %3Fgad_source%3D5, (16, 482), click, NULL): Clicks the advertisement at the bottom of the tip calculator, which redirects to a new source URL ("incline-to-packaging%3Futm_source%3DGoogle%26utm_medium%3DABM%26utm_campaign%3DITP_2020%26utm_content%3DEnglish_ElevateProtectWP_MPS%26gad_source%3D5").

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, the next step in the test case migration from the source application to the target application should be inputting the tip percentage. In the source application, this step is described as clearing the tip percentage field and inputting the value '15'. In the target application, this action can be performed on the element with the id 'com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/etTipAmount'. 

The action sequence for this step would be:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/etTipAmount, (104, 165), input, "15"): Input the tip amount '15' into the 'Tip' field.
~~~
Based on the action you provided, the corresponding UIAutomator2 with Python script would most likely be:

```python
d(resourceId="com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/etTipAmount").set_text("15")
```
When translating the action into the code, I prefer to use the widget's unique id to ensure the precision of the operation. The `set_text` function is used here to input the value into the EditText field.

After clicking, no new page is loaded and no new elements appear. The results of the calculation are displayed in the Tip Amount, Total with Tip, and Each Person Pays fields.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/etTipAmount, (104, 165), click, "15"): User clicks on the tip amount field. After the interaction, there's no new page. The potentially changed fields are the field for tip percentage itself and the resulting computed fields for tip amount, total with tip and each person pays.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/etBillTotal, (104, 211), click, "56.6"): The action of clicking and entering into the 'Bill Total' field allows the user to enter the total cost of the bill for calculation. After insertion of the bill amount, the 'calculate' button at the coordinates (60, 386) becomes functional to compute the total cost with tip considering the input number of persons and the percentage tip.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, "com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/btCalculate", (60, 386), click, "Calculate"): This button calculates the tip for the bill amount inputted. Once clicked, there isn't any new page or widget that appears. The results are displayed within pre-existing fields - "Tip Amount: ", "Total with Tip: ", and "Each Person Pays: ".

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/tvTipTotal, (97,282), click, "$ 0.15"): This action represents the user clicking on the 'Tip Amount' field. This doesn't navigate to a new page but likely triggers the calculation of the tip amount based on the user's input data in previous fields. The result is displayed in 'Tip Amount' field whose ID is 'com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/tvTipTotal'. This clicked control updates the current page but doesn't lead to a different page.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/tvTotalWithTip, (110, 315), click, "$ 1.15"): The user clicked it to see the final amount after adding the tip. After clicking, the page shows the same information, which means there was no navigation to a new page.
Based on the provided JSON data, the application remains on the same page after clicking 'Each Person Pays', where the widget ID corresponds to "com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/tvPersonPay". Therefore, the action primarily involves fetching the computed total per person from the tip calculation. Since the page does not navigate to a new screen, and no new widgets appear, the output format would be:

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/tvPersonPay, (136, 348), click, "Each Person Pays "$ 1.15"): Tapping on 'Each Person Pays' retrieves the computed per person total which remains "$ 1.15" after the action is executed.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/tvPersonPay, (136, 348), click, "$ 1.15"): Clicking to view amount each person needs to pay. No new elements appear in the next page on clicking.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided source test case semantics, current page's intentions, and executed action sequence, it appears that the next step in the migration process would be to verify the calculation result. In the source test case, this is done by asserting the presence of the expected total amount to be paid in the 'Total to Pay' field.

In the target app, the equivalent field seems to be the 'Total with Tip' field. Hence, the next action would be to assert that this field displays the expected total amount to be paid, which is '$65.09'.

Here is the next step of the migration:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/tvTotalWithTip, (110, 315), wait_until_text_presence, "text:$ 65.09"): Verify that the 'Total with Tip' field displays '$65.09' within 10 seconds, confirming the correct calculation.
~~~
Based on the given action input, the conversion to UIAutomator2 code in Python would be:

#### Output:
···
assert d(resourceId="com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/tvTotalWithTip").wait(timeout=10).get_text() == "$ 65.09"

For example, if you need to click an item with a specific id, provide me with the id and the action (click), so that I can generate the UIAutomator2 code.
