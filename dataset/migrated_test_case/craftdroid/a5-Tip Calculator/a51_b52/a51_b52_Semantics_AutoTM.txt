This test case is testing the functionality of a tip calculator application that calculates the amount each person needs to pay based on the bill amount, tip percentage, and the number of people.

The detailed process with serial numbers is as follows:

1. ACTION (EditText, anti.tip:id/bill, (), input, "56.6") : Clear the bill amount field and input "56.6" as the new bill amount.
2. ACTION (EditText, anti.tip:id/percent, (), input, "15") : Clear the tip percentage field and input "15" as the new tip percentage.
3. ACTION (EditText, anti.tip:id/people, (), input, "4") : Clear the number of people field, input "4" as the new number of people, and hide the keyboard.
4. ASSERT (EditText, anti.tip:id/each, (), wait_until_text_presence, "text:16.27") : Verify that the calculated amount each person needs to pay, "16.27", is correctly displayed within 10 seconds.
