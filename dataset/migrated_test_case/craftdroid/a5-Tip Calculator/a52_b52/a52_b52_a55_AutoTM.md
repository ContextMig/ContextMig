#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, the first step in the source test case is to input the bill amount into a specific EditText field. In the current page's intentions, the equivalent action would be to input the bill total into the EditText field with the id "com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/etBillTotal". Therefore, the next action to perform is to input the value '56.6' into this field.

Here is the output:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/etBillTotal, (104, 211), input, "56.6"): Input the bill amount
~~~
Based on the provided information, we aim to generate the UIAutomator2 code to perform an ACTION: to set the text "56.6" to a widget with the given ID and coordinates. Here is the code:

```python
d(resourceId="com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/etBillTotal").set_text("56.6")
```

Details:
- 'd' is the variable name for the UIAutomator2 device instance initiated by `u2.connect('ip')`.
- 'resourceId' represents the unique ID of the widget we want to interact with.
- 'set_text' is the method used to set the text "56.6" into the widget.

#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Tip Calculator, (16, 38), click, NULL): Clicking on this control does not lead to a new page but results in the recalculation of tip values on the current Tip Calculator page. The new values can be seen under new JSON values updated in 'Tip Amount:', 'Total with Tip:', and 'Each Person Pays:'.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/share_tip_info, (224, 28), click, NULL): Click to share the calculated tip info. As no new page or widget appears in the next JSON data, it's assumed that the related operation may open OS level sharing options or it might not be successfully captured.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, '', (280, 28), click, NULL): This action opens the more options list from the current calculate page. The page after clicking this control has a list of options including community (with id "com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/title"), share app (with id "com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/title"), rate app (with id "com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/title"), and blog (with id "com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/title").
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/etBillTotal, (104, 211), click, "56.6"): interact with this field to input or change the bill total. After clicking this input field, the page remains the same allowing the user to input a different bill total.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/etPerson, (104, 119), click, "1"): Increase or decrease the number of people. The current value is 1. After clicking this element, the number of people shared will change, affecting the total calculation on the next page.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/btCalculate, (60,386), click, 'Calculate'): The purpose of clicking on this button is to calculate the tip amount based on the inputted bill total and tip percentage. After this action, the 'Tip Amount:', 'Total with Tip:', and 'Each Person Pays:' fields are updated with new values based on calculations.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/etTipAmount, (104, 165), click, "15"): The action refers to clicking the field to enter the tip percentage. There is no new page or new widget appearing after performing this action. The widget retains its state and is ready for user input.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/tvTipTotal, (97, 282), click, "$ 0.15"): This action occurs when clicking on the 'Tip Amount' display field which doesn't trigger any transition. Nor does it open a new page or new widgets. However, touching may lead to highlighting or selection for text copy functionality in some cases. This contributes to the accessibility feature in Android allowing users to interact with the displayed elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/tvTotalWithTip, (110, 315), click, "$ 1.15"): The "Total with Tip" widget when clicked, stays on the current page without leading to a different page or showing additional dialog options. Hence, there is no direct impact on other widgets.
Based on the provided information, we can observe that no new page appears and no new widget is added. Therefore, no new event sequence related to the widget "Each Person Pays" is identified. Thus, since there are no changes in the sequence, an action related to this widget does not lead to the appearance of a dialog/popupMenu or new page. Perhaps the "Each Person Pays" widget is just for display of a calculated value and does not trigger any action on clicking.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/tvPersonPay, (136, 348), click, "$ 1.15"): Click to share or view more options related to the per person payment. The action does not cause navigation to a new page, but rather a dialog or an option menu might appear.

On the next page, the calculated results are displayed in various text fields, including 'Tip Amount: $ 8.49', 'Total with Tip: $ 65.09', and 'Each Person Pays: $ 65.09'.
Based on the provided JSON data and the specific Widget ID, the action and purpose is as follows:

ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/btReset, (60, 434), click, "Reset"): The button resets the calculator to initial state by clearing the entered values. This is verified by comparing the current page JSON to the next page JSON - the text value for the EditText with id "com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/etBillTotal" changes from "56.6" to "1".
ACTION (android.view.View, NULL, (267, 513), click, NULL): Click to open the website 'belgraveaccountants.co.uk'. The page after clicking this control navigates to a new page, which presumably contains information from 'belgraveaccountants.co.uk'. The URL button control has an id of NULL.

#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
Based on the provided information, there's no specific widget ID found in the current page JSON. However, supposing the interaction refers to the 'Tip Calculator' textview field with an index of '0', the text itself is a label. The role of this element is informational, displaying the title of the current page for the user to understand which calculator they are currently viewing. 

Since it is non-interactive (as understood from the empty control array), the clickable control you provided might be an error. However, if it isn't an error and is, in fact, clickable, then the action might represent switching to different type of calculator or it may perform some other action not apparent from the JSON provided.

Please confirm the widget ID and the controls for the widget ID, so I can generate an accurate formal response of Output Format.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided source test case semantics and executed action sequence, we have successfully migrated the first three steps of the source test case to the target app. The next step is to verify the per-person amount calculation. 

However, from the current page's intentions, there's no direct widget to assert the per-person amount directly. The closest match is the intention to click on the TextView with the ID "com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/tvPersonPay", which displays the total amount each person has to pay. 

So, the next step is to assert the per-person amount by clicking on the TextView with the ID "com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/tvPersonPay" and verifying the displayed value. 

Here is your next step:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/tvPersonPay, (136, 348), wait_until_text_presence, "text:16.27"): Verify that the per-person amount is correctly calculated and displayed as '16.27' within 10 seconds.
~~~
The UIAutomator2 python code to accomplish this is:

```python
assert (d(resourceId="com.jpstudiosonline.tipcalculator:id/tvPersonPay").wait(timeout=10.0).get_text() == "16.27")
```
