#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the given parameters, the test case is testing the search functionality in Mozilla Focus browser and we have already successfully navigated to the https://www.ics.uci.edu page. The next step in the test case is to verify the presence of an element with the content description 'Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences'. 

Looking at the current page's intent description, none of the mentioned elements have the required content description. However, there is a scroll action available on the android.webkit.WebView element that may reveal additional elements on the page. Therefore, our next action should be to scroll the page:

~~~
ACTION (android.webkit.WebView, NULL, (0, 24), scroll, NULL): Scroll the page to reveal additional elements.
~~~

After this action, I would expect you to provide a new interface description for further matching. If the required element is still not found, we can continue to scroll until all elements on the page have been revealed. If the element is not found after all elements have been revealed, then the test case cannot be successfully migrated and we can conclude with 'NOT FOUND'.
Based on your input, here is the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

d.swipe(0, 24, 0, 0)
