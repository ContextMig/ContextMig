#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed actions and the current page's intent description, the next step would be to verify the presence of the specific element - 'Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences'.

However, the current interface does not provide an action that directly corresponds to this verification. The closest actions available are to interact with the WebView, the UCI ICS logo, or the Accessibility Tools. All of these actions are related to navigation within the page, but none of them provide an explicit verification of the presence of the specific element.

Therefore, the next action would be to interact with the WebView, as it is the most likely to contain the specific element. If this action fails to verify the presence of the element, the following steps would involve interactions with the UCI ICS logo and the Accessibility Tools, in that order.

~~~
ACTION (android.webkit.WebView, NULL, (0, 80), scroll, NULL): Scroll to view the contents of the UC Irvine Donald Bren School of Information & Computer Sciences home page.
~~~
Based on the requirement, the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python would be:

```python
d.swipe(0, 80, 0, 0, 0.1)
```
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
Considering that the Widget ID, Previous Page JSON, Current Page JSON and Next Page JSON don't have any changes after an action, it implies there's no event triggered with the interaction. Alternatively, the system may be not responsive or the interaction was not registered.

Therefore, in the context of this example, there's no action to report.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, NULL, (268, 0), click, NULL): Click to visit Accessibility Tools. The page after clicking this control remains the same because no navigational change is triggered.
ACTION (android.view.View, Accessing STEM in Higher Education, (16, 229), click, NULL): The interaction brings up more details about Accessing STEM in Higher Education. Upon clicking, it leads to a new page that includes more details about how high school students who are blind or low vision can visit ICS and learn about college life.

ACTION (android.view.View, NULL, (16, 368), click, NULL): Click to learn more about high school students who are blind or low vision visiting ICS & learning about college life. The page after clicking this element stays the same, indicating that no additional information or interface changes have been provided from this interaction.
ACTION (android.view.View, NULL, (16, 536), click, NULL): Click to read more about "Accessing STEM in Higher Education". The next page displays detailed information about the event including a picture, date, and sharing options.
ACTION (android.widget.Image, AccessSTEM_PeterGroup_portrait, (0, 10), click, NULL): Click to view the "AccessSTEM_PeterGroup_portrait" image. The next page displays the same image with slight adjustments in position.
