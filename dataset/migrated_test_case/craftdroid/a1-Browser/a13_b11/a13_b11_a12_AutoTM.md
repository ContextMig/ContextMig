Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, the next step should be to verify the presence of the specific element "Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences" on the webpage. However, the current page's intent description doesn't contain an element with the same content description. 

Considering the functional requirements of the test case, the closest match in the current page's intent description is the action 'Click to read more about Accessing STEM in Higher Education'. This action might lead to a page where the specific element could be present. 

So, the next step could be to execute this action and then assert the presence of the specific element. Here is the output:

~~~
ACTION (android.view.View, "", (16, 312), click, NULL): Click to read more about Accessing STEM in Higher Education
ASSERT (View, , (), wait_until_element_presence, "xpath://android.view.View[@content-desc=\"Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences\"]"): Verify that the element with the content description 'Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences' is present within 10 seconds.
