However, the current interface does not provide any elements or actions that directly allow us to verify the presence of this element. Therefore, we need to make an assumption and use the action related to the WebView element, which navigates to the UCI ICS homepage, to indirectly verify the presence of the specific element. 

~~~
ACTION (android.webkit.WebView, Home - UC Irvine Donald Bren School of Information & Computer Sciences, (0, 80), click, NULL): Navigate to UC Irvine Donald Bren School of Information & Computer Sciences homepage.

···
d.click(0, 80)
···
In this case, the action is a click operation on the WebView element, and since the coordinates are provided, we use the `click()` method with the given coordinates. The ID and element are not used in this case as the coordinates are precise.
