Based on the provided information, the UIAutomator2 code in Python would be as follows:

```python
d(resourceId="de.baumann.browser:id/main_omnibox_input").set_text("https://www.ics.uci.edu")
d.press("enter")
assert d(description="Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences").wait(timeout=10)

d(resourceId="de.baumann.browser:id/main_omnibox_input").set_text("https://uci.edu")
d.press("enter")
assert d(description="UCI homepage").wait(timeout=10)

d.press("back")
assert d(description="Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences").wait(timeout=10)
```

In this code:

- The `set_text()` function is used to input the URL into the URL field.
- The `press("enter")` function is used to simulate the press of the enter key.
- The `wait(timeout=10)` function is used to wait until the element with the specified content description is present within 10 seconds.
- The `press("back")` function is used to navigate back to the previous page.
- The `assert` statement is used to verify that the element with the specified content description is present.
