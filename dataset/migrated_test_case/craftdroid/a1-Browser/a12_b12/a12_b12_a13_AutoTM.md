If it is present, we can then proceed to the next step, which is to return to the previous page and verify the presence of the element with the content description 'Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences'.

~~~
ASSERT (android.webkit.WebView, Home | UC Irvine, (0, 80), wait_until_element_presence, "xpath://android.view.View[@content-desc=\"UCI homepage\"]"): Verify that the element with the content description 'UCI homepage' is present within 10 seconds.

The following is the transformed UIAutomator2 code for the provided actions:

```python
import time
# Verify that the element with the content description 'UCI homepage' is present within 10 seconds.
start_time = time.time()
while time.time() - start_time < 10:
    if d.xpath('//android.view.View[@content-desc="UCI homepage"]').exists:
        break
    time.sleep(1)
else:
    assert False, "Element with content description 'UCI homepage' not found within 10 seconds."

# Return to the previous page.
d.press('back')

# Verify that the element with the content description 'Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences' is present within 10 seconds after returning to the previous page.
start_time = time.time()
while time.time() - start_time < 10:
