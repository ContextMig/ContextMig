#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case semantics, the current step of test migration seems to be after the input of the keyword 'Automated' into the search field. The next step in the source test case is to verify the presence of the email with the subject 'Automated Software Engineering' within 10 seconds after the search.

To achieve this, we can use the intention 'ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.my.mail:id/text, (88, 191), click, "Automated Software Engineering")' which represents the action of selecting an email titled 'Automated Software Engineering'. 

However, since we want to verify the presence of this email and not click it, we should use an ASSERT action instead of an ACTION. The oracle in this case would be the text 'Automated Software Engineering'. 

Therefore, the next step of the migration would be:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.my.mail:id/text, (88, 191), wait_until_text_presence, "Automated Software Engineering"): Verify that the email with the subject 'Automated Software Engineering' is present within 10 seconds after the search.
~~~
```
assert (d(text="Automated Software Engineering").wait(timeout=10000))
```
