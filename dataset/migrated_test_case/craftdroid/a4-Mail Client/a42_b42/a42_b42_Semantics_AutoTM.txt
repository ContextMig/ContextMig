2. ACTION (TextView, com.appple.app.email:id/compose, (), click, NULL) : Click on the "Compose" button to start composing a new email.
3. ASSERT (MultiAutoCompleteTextView, com.appple.app.email:id/to, (), wait_until_element_presence, "id:to") : Verify that the "To" field is present within 15 seconds.
4. ACTION (MultiAutoCompleteTextView, com.appple.app.email:id/to, (), input, "autotm1234@gmail.com") : Input the recipient email address 'autotm1234@gmail.com' into the "To" field.
5. ACTION (EditText, com.appple.app.email:id/subject, (), input, "ICSTSuperCool") : Input 'ICSTSuperCool' as the subject of the email.
6. ACTION (EditText, com.appple.app.email:id/message_content, (), input, "ICSTSuperCoolBody") : Input 'ICSTSuperCoolBody' as the body of the email.
7. ACTION (TextView, com.appple.app.email:id/send, (), click, NULL) : Click on the "Send" button to send the email.
