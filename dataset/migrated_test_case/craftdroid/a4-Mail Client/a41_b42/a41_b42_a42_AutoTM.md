### Semantics of Source Test case
> This test case is testing the email composition and sending functionality in the K-9 Mail app. It verifies the presence of the Inbox, composes a new email, inputs recipient, subject, and body, sends the email, and finally verifies the presence of the sent email in the message list.
> 
> The detailed process with serial numbers is as follows:
> 
> 1. ASSERT (TextView, com.fsck.k9:id/actionbar_title_first, (), wait_until_text_presence, "Inbox") : Verify that the 'Inbox' text is present within 15 seconds.
> 2. ACTION (TextView, com.fsck.k9:id/compose, (), click, NULL) : Click on the 'Compose' button to start composing a new email.
> 3. ASSERT (MultiAutoCompleteTextView, com.fsck.k9:id/to, (), wait_until_element_presence, "com.fsck.k9:id/to") : Verify that the 'To' field is present within 15 seconds.
> 4. ACTION (MultiAutoCompleteTextView, com.fsck.k9:id/to, (), input, "autotm1234@gmail.com") : Input the recipient email 'autotm1234@gmail.com' into the 'To' field and hide the keyboard.
> 5. ACTION (EditText, com.fsck.k9:id/subject, (), input, "ICSTSuperCool") : Input the subject 'ICSTSuperCool' into the 'Subject' field.
> 6. ACTION (EditText, com.fsck.k9:id/message_content, (), input, "ICSTSuperCoolBody") : Input the body 'ICSTSuperCoolBody' into the 'Message text' field.
> 7. ACTION (TextView, com.fsck.k9:id/send, (), click, NULL) : Click on the 'Send' button to send the composed email.
> 8. ASSERT (TextView, com.fsck.k9:id/subject, (), wait_until_text_presence, "ICSTSuperCool") : Verify that the sent email with the subject 'ICSTSuperCool' is present in the message list within 20 seconds.

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.appple.app.email:id/actionbar_title_first, (49, 26), wait_until_text_presence, "Inbox"): Verify that the 'Inbox' text is present within 15 seconds.
~~~
The transformed UIAutomator2 code is:

···
assert d(resourceId="com.appple.app.email:id/actionbar_title_first").wait(timeout=15).get_text() == "Inbox"
···

Here, `d(resourceId="com.appple.app.email:id/actionbar_title_first").wait(timeout=15).get_text()` waits for the TextView identified by resourceId "com.appple.app.email:id/actionbar_title_first" to appear for a maximum duration of 15 seconds, and then retrieves the text present in that TextView. This text is then compared with "Inbox". If the comparison returns true, it means that 'Inbox' text appeared within 15 seconds, otherwise it didn't.

### Generated UIAutomator2 Code:

The first assert is to check whether the 'To' field is present within 15 seconds. The second action is to input an email address into the 'To' field.

···
assert (d(resourceId="com.appple.app.email:id/to").wait(timeout=15000).exists==True)
d(resourceId="com.appple.app.email:id/to").set_text("autotm1234@gmail.com")
d.press("back")
···

In the code above, we use resourceId to locate elements. We start a wait operation for 15 seconds to check if the 'To' field is present. After the assertion, we assign the inputted email address to the "To" field and press 'back' to hide the keyboard.
