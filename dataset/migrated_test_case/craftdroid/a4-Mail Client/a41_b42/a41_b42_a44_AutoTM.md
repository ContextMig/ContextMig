### Semantics of Source Test case
> This test case is testing the email composition and sending functionality in the K-9 Mail app. It verifies the presence of the Inbox, composes a new email, inputs recipient, subject, and body, sends the email, and finally verifies the presence of the sent email in the message list.
> 
> The detailed process with serial numbers is as follows:
> 
> 1. ASSERT (TextView, com.fsck.k9:id/actionbar_title_first, (), wait_until_text_presence, "Inbox") : Verify that the 'Inbox' text is present within 15 seconds.
> 2. ACTION (TextView, com.fsck.k9:id/compose, (), click, NULL) : Click on the 'Compose' button to start composing a new email.
> 3. ASSERT (MultiAutoCompleteTextView, com.fsck.k9:id/to, (), wait_until_element_presence, "com.fsck.k9:id/to") : Verify that the 'To' field is present within 15 seconds.
> 4. ACTION (MultiAutoCompleteTextView, com.fsck.k9:id/to, (), input, "autotm1234@gmail.com") : Input the recipient email 'autotm1234@gmail.com' into the 'To' field and hide the keyboard.
> 5. ACTION (EditText, com.fsck.k9:id/subject, (), input, "ICSTSuperCool") : Input the subject 'ICSTSuperCool' into the 'Subject' field.
> 6. ACTION (EditText, com.fsck.k9:id/message_content, (), input, "ICSTSuperCoolBody") : Input the body 'ICSTSuperCoolBody' into the 'Message text' field.
> 7. ACTION (TextView, com.fsck.k9:id/send, (), click, NULL) : Click on the 'Send' button to send the composed email.
> 8. ASSERT (TextView, com.fsck.k9:id/subject, (), wait_until_text_presence, "ICSTSuperCool") : Verify that the sent email with the subject 'ICSTSuperCool' is present in the message list within 20 seconds.

### Process

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided sequence of actions which has not begun yet, we need to start the migration process of the source test case into the target application. Let's begin by matching the first step of the source test case to an appropriate action in the target application.

### Source Test Case Step 1:
- ASSERT (TextView, com.fsck.k9:id/actionbar_title_first, (), wait_until_text_presence, "Inbox") : Verify that the 'Inbox' text is present within 15 seconds.

### Matching in Current Page's Intent Description:
The closest match in the current page's intent description to verify the presence of "Inbox" text is:
- ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.my.mail:id/folder_name, (72, 38), click, "Inbox 1"): To expand and view different mail filters such as "All", "Unread", "Flagged" and "With Attachments".

### Migration Action:
We will use the above action to verify the presence of the Inbox. Since the source action is an assertion and the target action is a click, we'll perform the click and then assert the presence of the text "Inbox 1".

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.my.mail:id/folder_name, (72, 38), click, NULL): Click to verify the presence of the Inbox.
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.my.mail:id/folder_name, (72, 38), wait_until_text_presence, "Inbox 1"): Verify that the 'Inbox' text is present within 15 seconds.
~~~
The provided input consists of two actions and one assertion. 

The action suggests that we need to perform a click operation on the widget with the identifier `com.my.mail:id/folder_name` using the UIAutomator2 Python driver. Subsequently, an assertion is made to confirm if the 'Inbox' text is present within 15 seconds. 

Here is the corresponding UIAutomator2 code using Python:

```python
# Perform the click action on the mentioned UI element
d(resourceId="com.my.mail:id/folder_name").click()

# Assertion
assert d(resourceId="com.my.mail:id/folder_name").wait(timeout=15000).until(lambda e: e.get_text() == "Inbox 1")
```
In the first line of the code, `d(resourceId="com.my.mail:id/folder_name").click()` performs the click action.

Then, `d(resourceId="com.my.mail:id/folder_name").wait(timeout=15000).until(lambda e: e.get_text() == "Inbox 1")` waits until the text "Inbox 1" appears for a maximum of 15 seconds. It then checks whether the text of the element with the resource id `com.my.mail:id/folder_name` is "Inbox 1". If it is, the output is True, and it continues; if not, it throws an `Uiautomator2.exceptions.UiObjectNotFoundError` error. 

This code is converted based on the coordinates you provided. However, please note that executing UI tests based on coordinates may lead to unstable tests if the application's layout changes. Hence, it is generally recommended to use unique identifiers when possible.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, com.my.mail:id/spinner_item_internal, (72, 38), click, NULL): Click to expand or collapse filter options. No navigation to a new page, but provides interaction with list items such as 'All', 'Unread', 'Flagged', 'With Attachments' for sorting or filtering the inbox contents.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, com.my.mail:id/filter_icon, (84, 46), click, NULL): Reveals filter options for the email list. Clicking on this control toggles the visibility of filter choices such as "All," "Unread," "Flagged," and "With Attachments."
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.my.mail:id/filter_name, (128, 46), click, "All"): Click to navigate and filter the mail list by 'All'. This action transitions to a view where the emails are categorized to show all mails regardless of their read or unread status.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.my.mail:id/filter_name, NULL, click, NULL): Filter the email view to display only those with attachments. The new page shows the emails filtered by attachment.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided source test case semantics, the current page's intentions, and the sequence of actions already executed on the target application, it seems we have successfully migrated the first step of the source test case to the target application. The next step in the source test case is to click on the 'Compose' button to start composing a new email.

However, the current page's intentions do not provide any component that directly corresponds to the 'Compose' action in the source test case. Therefore, we may need to explore other pages or options in the target application to find a suitable match for this action. 

Here is my suggestion for the next step:

~~~
RETURN: Go back to the previous page to find the 'Compose' button or a similar function.
~~~
Certainly, based on the given instruction for the RETURN action, we need to simulate a back press on the device to go to the previous page. Here is the uiautomator2 code to achieve this:

```python
d.press('back')
```

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Given the provided information, it appears that the test case migration is currently at the point after the email body has been inputted. The next step in the source test case is to send the email. The corresponding action in the target app's current page intentions that matches this functionality is:

```
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.my.mail:id/toolbar_action_send, (268, 28), click, NULL): Click to send the email.
```

This is functionally similar to step 7 in the source test case. Therefore, the next action to perform in the target app would be to click on the send button. Here is the response in the required format:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.my.mail:id/toolbar_action_send, (268, 28), click, NULL): Click to send the email.
~~~

After this action, the next step in the source test case is to verify the presence of the sent email in the message list. However, without further information on the target app's intentions or elements that would allow for such a verification, I cannot provide the next step in the migration. If there is an intention that allows for the verification of the sent email, please provide it so that the migration can continue.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence, the test migration has successfully reached the step after sending the email. The next step in the source test case is to verify the presence of the sent email in the message list. We need to find an action in the current page's intentions that corresponds to verifying the presence of a sent email.

Looking at the current page's intentions, there isn't a direct match for verifying the presence of a sent email. However, we can use the 'ASSERT' command to check for the email subject in the message list to ensure the email was sent successfully.

Let's proceed with the next step:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.my.mail:id/subject, (88, 112), wait_until_text_presence, "ICSTSuperCool"): Verify that the sent email with the subject 'ICSTSuperCool' is present in the message list within 20 seconds.
DONE
~~~

With this assertion, we are checking for the presence of the subject 'ICSTSuperCool' in the message list, which would confirm that the email has been sent. Since this is the final step of the source test case, and we have found a corresponding action in the target app, we can conclude the migration with 'DONE'.
### Output:
Based on your directives, here is the converted python code:

···
import time
for _ in range(20):  # check 20 times with 1s interval
    if d(resourceId="com.my.mail:id/subject").get_text() == "ICSTSuperCool":
        break
    time.sleep(1)
else:  # if loop completes normally without break, assert False
    assert False, "Text 'ICSTSuperCool' not found within 20 seconds"
···
Here I created a loop to check the presence of the text 'ICSTSuperCool' in the element specified by resourceId every 1 second for 20 times. If the text is not present even after 20 checks, it asserts False and raises an AssertionError with a custom message.
