### Semantics of Source Test case
> ```
> This test case is designed to validate the search functionality within an email application, ensuring that specific email subjects can be searched for and verified.
> 
> The detailed process with serial numbers is as follows:
> 
> 1. ASSERT (TextView, com.appple.app.email:id/subject, (), wait_until_text_presence, "text:Another rabbit hole") : Verify that the text 'Another rabbit hole' is present within 10 seconds.
> 2. ACTION (TextView, com.appple.app.email:id/search, (), click, NULL) : Click on the search icon to activate the search field.
> 3. ASSERT (EditText, android:id/search_src_text, (), wait_until_element_presence, "id:search_src_text") : Verify that the search input field is present within 10 seconds.
> 4. ACTION (EditText, android:id/search_src_text, (), input, "Automated") : Input the text 'Automated' into the search field and press enter.

### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (0, 24), click, NULL): Click to navigate up. The page after clicking this control shows the "Folders" screen with multiple folders listed (Drafts, Inbox, Outbox, Sent, Spam, Trash) each with their own statuses and new message counts if applicable.
```
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.fsck.k9:id/actionbar_title_first, (49, 26), click, "Inbox"): Click on the inbox title to refresh or load emails. No navigation to a new page occurs, but the emails in the inbox are updated or loaded.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.fsck.k9:id/actionbar_title_sub, (49, 51), click, "Next poll In 23 minutes"): Clicking on this control queries the next polling time for mail. Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page, but maintains the current display of Inbox, Next poll, and unread count information.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.fsck.k9:id/actionbar_unread_count, (276, 24), click, NULL): Click to view unread messages. Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page but potentially refreshes the inbox to focus or filter on unread messages. There is no change in the element id "com.fsck.k9:id/actionbar_unread_count" which suggests the action might be related to displaying unread message count without navigating away.
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, com.fsck.k9:id/message_list, (0, 72), click, NULL): Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but it probably triggers loading or refreshing of email items without a significant change in the user interface elements as per the provided Next Page JSON data.
ACTION (com.fsck.k9.ui.ContactBadge, com.fsck.k9:id/contact_badge, (16, 86), click, NULL): Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, indicating the probable display of a context menu or action related to the contact represented by the badge, but specific resultant widgets cannot be determined from the provided JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.fsck.k9:id/subject, (65, 77), click, "Another rabbit hole"): Click to view the full details of the email titled "Another rabbit hole". The next page displays the full email content, including sender information "tm auto", recipient "autotm123@outlook.com", and sent date "Aug 8, 2024, 19:42". Additional options such as downloading the complete message are available.
```
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.fsck.k9:id/date, (273, 77), click, "Aug 8"): Click to view the message details. After clicking, message details are displayed with from, to, date, and subject, including a clickable email address autotm123@outlook.com and a download button for the complete message.

ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, android:id/closeButton, (0, 24), click, NULL): Click to close the search interface. Returning to the message list without performing a search operation.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, android:id/search_src_text, (63, 29), click, "Search"): Click to activate the search field. Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page, but it allows the user to input text into the search field for searching contents in the app.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided information, the source test case's next step is:

```
3. ASSERT (EditText, android:id/search_src_text, (), wait_until_element_presence, "id:search_src_text") : Verify that the search input field is present within 10 seconds.
```

The current page's intent that corresponds to this step is:

```
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, android:id/search_src_text, (63, 29), click, "Search"): Click to activate the search field.
```

The last executed action sequence indicates that the search has been activated successfully, and the presence of the email subject 'Another rabbit hole' has been verified. The next step in the source test case involves asserting the presence of the search input field.

Given that the search field has been activated in the last executed action, we can now perform the assertion to verify the presence of the search input field.

Here is the next step of the migration, which is the assertion of the search input field's presence:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.EditText, android:id/search_src_text, (63, 29), wait_until_element_presence, "id:search_src_text"): Verify that the search input field is present within 10 seconds.
~~~
···
d.click(63, 29)
assert d(resourceId="android:id/search_src_text").exists(timeout=10)

ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, android:id/closeButton, (0, 24), click, NULL): Clicking on closeButton navigates to the inbox page displaying an overview of emails and primary actions. New elements include inbox title 'Inbox' with id 'com.fsck.k9:id/actionbar_title_first' and unread count '1' with id 'com.fsck.k9:id/actionbar_unread_count'.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, android:id/search_src_text, (63, 29), click, "Search"): Click to activate the search field. Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page, but it allows the user to input text into the search field for searching contents in the app.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we have already executed the following steps from the source test case:

1. ASSERT (TextView, com.appple.app.email:id/subject, (), wait_until_text_presence, "text:Another rabbit hole"): This step has been completed successfully.
2. ACTION (TextView, com.appple.app.email:id/search, (), click, NULL): This step has been completed successfully.
3. ASSERT (EditText, android:id/search_src_text, (), wait_until_element_presence, "id:search_src_text"): This step has been completed successfully.

The next step in the source test case is:

4. ACTION (EditText, android:id/search_src_text, (), input, "Automated"): Input the text 'Automated' into the search field and press enter.

Given that the search field has been activated and is present, we can now proceed with the input action for the search term 'Automated'. Since the source test case involves pressing enter after inputting the text, we should include this as part of the action if the target app also requires pressing enter to initiate the search.

The corresponding action for the target app, based on the current page's intentions, is:

ACTION (android.widget.EditText, android:id/search_src_text, (63, 29), input, "Automated"): Input the text 'Automated' into the search field and press enter.

Since the next step in the source test case is to verify the presence of a specific text after the search, we will need to wait for the search to complete before performing this assertion. However, this step will be considered in the next interaction as we are focusing on one step at a time.

Here is the output for the current step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, android:id/search_src_text, (63, 29), input, "Automated"): Input 'Automated' and press enter.
~~~
```
d(resourceId="android:id/search_src_text").send_keys("Automated")
d.press('enter')
d(resourceId="android:id/search_src_text").send_keys("Automated")
d.press('enter')
```

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, the source test case has been partially executed on the target app with success. The last confirmed action was the input of the text 'Automated' into the search field and pressing enter, which corresponds to step 4 of the source test case.

The next step in the source test case is:

5. ASSERT (TextView, com.appple.app.email:id/subject, (), wait_until_text_presence, "text:Automated Software Engineering") : Verify that the text 'Automated Software Engineering' is present within 10 seconds after the search.

Looking at the current page's intentions, the action that matches this assertion is:

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.fsck.k9:id/subject, (65, 77), click, "Automated Software Engineering"): Click to view more details of the email.

Since this is an assertion to verify the presence of the text "Automated Software Engineering," we should look for the presence of this email subject in the list. If found, it confirms that the search function has worked correctly.

Therefore, the next step is to assert the presence of the email subject "Automated Software Engineering" in the search results.

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.fsck.k9:id/subject, (65, 77), wait_until_text_presence, "text:Automated Software Engineering"): Verify that the text 'Automated Software Engineering' is present within 10 seconds after the search.
DONE
~~~

This assertion completes the test case migration, as all steps of the source test case have now been matched and migrated to the target app.
