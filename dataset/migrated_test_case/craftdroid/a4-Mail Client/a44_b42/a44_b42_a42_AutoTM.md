### Semantics of Source Test case
> This test case is testing the email sending functionality that tests navigation to the compose email screen, inputting recipient, subject, and body, sending the email, and verifying the presence of the sent email in the inbox.
> 
> The detailed process with serial numbers is as follows:
> 
> 1. ASSERT (TextView, com.my.mail:id/folder_name, (), wait_until_text_presence, "Inbox") : Verify that the 'Inbox' text is present within 15 seconds.
> 2. ACTION (TextView, com.my.mail:id/toolbar_action_new, (), click, NULL) : Click on the 'New Message' button to navigate to the compose email screen.
> 3. ASSERT (EditText, com.my.mail:id/edit_text_to, (), wait_until_element_presence, "edit_text_to") : Verify that the recipient input field is present within 15 seconds.
> 4. ACTION (EditText, com.my.mail:id/edit_text_to, (), input, "autotm1234@gmail.com") : Input the recipient email 'autotm1234@gmail.com' into the recipient field and hide the keyboard.
> 5. ACTION (EditText, com.my.mail:id/subject, (), input, "ICSTSuperCool") : Input the subject 'ICSTSuperCool' into the subject field.
> 6. ACTION (EditText, com.my.mail:id/mailbox_create_new_body, (), input, "ICSTSuperCoolBody") : Input the body 'ICSTSuperCoolBody' into the body field.
> 7. ACTION (TextView, com.my.mail:id/toolbar_action_send, (), click, NULL) : Click on the 'Send' button to send the email.

### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, "", (0, 24), click, NULL): Click to navigate up and access the folders page. The page after clicking this control shows different mail folders including Drafts, Email-errors, Inbox, Spam, Trash, and Outbox.

ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, com.appple.app.email:layout/message_list_item_footer, (0, 140), click, NULL): When the 'Load up to 25 more' button is clicked, it loads additional emails onto the current page, rather than navigating to a new one.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.appple.app.email:id/main_text, (83, 159), click, NULL): Click to load up to 25 more messages. After clicking this control, the loading process begins as indicated by the text "Loading messagesâ€¦" with id "com.appple.app.email:id/main_text".

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.appple.app.email:id/add_cc_bcc, (96, 24), click, NULL): Click to open compose mail with additional CC and BCC fields. The page after clicking this control lets users add Cc and Bcc recipients for the mail, with respective id's "com.appple.app.email:id/cc" and "com.appple.app.email:id/bcc", and also includes respective field buttons with id's "com.appple.app.email:id/add_cc" and "com.appple.app.email:id/add_bcc".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.appple.app.email:id/add_attachment, (152, 24), click, NULL): Click to add an attachment. Since the Next Page JSON is empty, clicking this widget does not result in navigation or new interactive elements being displayed.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.appple.app.email:id/send, (208, 24), click, NULL): Click to send an email message. Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page, but a dialog/popup warning which includes a message stating "You must add at least one recipient." appears, indicating a failed send attempt due to missing recipient information.

ACTION (android.widget.MultiAutoCompleteTextView, com.appple.app.email:id/to, (6, 87), click, NULL): Clicking this control opens an interface for the user to add a recipient email address to the 'To' field in the email composition page. The resultant page after this interaction remains the email composition page, but the 'To' field is updated with the entered recipient.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.appple.app.email:id/add_to, (266, 79), click, NULL): Clicking on this button is intended to add a recipient to the 'To' field of the email. Post-interaction, no new page is rendered nor are there any visible changes in the current page.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.appple.app.email:id/subject, (6, 127), click, NULL): Clicking on the 'subject' widget brings up the keyboard for user to enter the subject for the email. The next page retains the same layout including the 'subject' widget for editing.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.MultiAutoCompleteTextView, com.appple.app.email:id/to, (6, 87), wait_until_element_presence): Verify that the recipient input field is present within 15 seconds.
~~~
Given the input, here is the corresponding UIAutomator2 code:

```python
assert d(resourceId="com.appple.app.email:id/to").wait(timeout=15)
```

In this code, `d(resourceId="com.appple.app.email:id/to")` refers to the UI element with the ID "com.appple.app.email:id/to". The `wait(timeout=15)` function checks if the element is present within 15 seconds. If it's not present after 15 seconds, then the line of code will throw an exception, indicating that the test case has failed.
   
Thus, the transformed action verifies the presence of the recipient input field within 15 seconds, as per the initial instruction.
