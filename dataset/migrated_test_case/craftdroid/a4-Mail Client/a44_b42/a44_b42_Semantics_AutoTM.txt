3. ASSERT (EditText, com.my.mail:id/edit_text_to, (), wait_until_element_presence, "edit_text_to") : Verify that the recipient input field is present within 15 seconds.
4. ACTION (EditText, com.my.mail:id/edit_text_to, (), input, "autotm1234@gmail.com") : Input the recipient email 'autotm1234@gmail.com' into the recipient field and hide the keyboard.
5. ACTION (EditText, com.my.mail:id/subject, (), input, "ICSTSuperCool") : Input the subject 'ICSTSuperCool' into the subject field.
6. ACTION (EditText, com.my.mail:id/mailbox_create_new_body, (), input, "ICSTSuperCoolBody") : Input the body 'ICSTSuperCoolBody' into the body field.
7. ACTION (TextView, com.my.mail:id/toolbar_action_send, (), click, NULL) : Click on the 'Send' button to send the email.
