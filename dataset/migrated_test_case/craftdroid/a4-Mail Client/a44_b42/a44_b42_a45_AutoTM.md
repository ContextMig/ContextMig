Based on the provided source test case semantics and the current page's intentions, the first step in the source test case is to verify the presence of the 'Inbox' text. Let's match this with the appropriate action from the current page's intentions.

The closest match from the current page's intentions that correlates with verifying the presence of the 'Inbox' text would be using the TextView element with id `park.outlook.sign.in.client:id/folder_name`. This element is used to switch folder view, and after clicking, a dropdown menu appears with options including 'Inbox'. 

Since the first operation in the executed action sequence indicates no actions have been performed yet, we will begin by asserting the presence of the 'Inbox' text in the TextView element.

Here is the migration for the first step:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, park.outlook.sign.in.client:id/folder_name, (16, 40), wait_until_text_presence, "Inbox"): Verify that the 'Inbox' text is present within 15 seconds.
~~~
···
