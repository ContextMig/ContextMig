### Semantics of Source Test case
> ```
> This test case is testing the email creation and sending functionality within an email application, verifying both the presence of the "Inbox" label and the successful creation and sending of an email with a specific subject.
> 
> The detailed process with serial numbers is as follows:
> 
> 1. ASSERT (TextView, park.outlook.sign.in.client:id/folder_name, (), wait_until_text_presence, "text:Inbox") : Verify that the 'Inbox' label is present within 15 seconds.
> 2. ACTION (TextView, park.outlook.sign.in.client:id/toolbar_action_new, (), click, NULL) : Click on the 'New Message' button to start composing a new email.
> 3. ASSERT (EditText, park.outlook.sign.in.client:id/edit_text_to, (), wait_until_element_presence, "id:edit_text_to") : Verify that the recipient input field is present within 15 seconds.
> 4. ACTION (EditText, park.outlook.sign.in.client:id/edit_text_to, (), input, "autotm1234@gmail.com") : Input the recipient email 'autotm1234@gmail.com' into the 'To' field.

### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (0, 24), click, NULL): Navigate to the folder management view. Swiping on this control navigates to a new page containing folders such as Inbox, Drafts, Sent, and Trash, as indicated by the change in the page elements with IDs like "com.appple.app.email:id/folder_name".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.appple.app.email:id/actionbar_title_first, (49, 26), click, "Inbox"): Click to navigate to the inbox view. Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page, but it is intended to filter or sort emails corresponding to the inbox label. The page remains unchanged, indicating a reload or refresh of content might have occurred with the same widget functionality maintained for email sorting or filtering.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.appple.app.email:id/actionbar_title_sub, (49, 51), click, NULL): Purpose: Click to navigate to the account settings, where you can manage your email account. After clicking, the interface remains consistent with the list of emails in the 'Inbox'. The only difference is this interaction might have activated a background process to fetch the latest emails from the server.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.appple.app.email:id/actionbar_add_new_account, (237, 28), click, NULL): Click to open the 'New Account' setup page, initiating a set of widgets for entering 'Email address', 'Password', 'Show password' checkbox, 'Advanced Option' settings, as well as 'Manual Setup' and 'Next' button.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.appple.app.email:id/actionbar_unread_count, (276, 24), click, "1"): Click to view the unread emails. After clicking on this control, the page does not change, it remains on the inbox page.
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, android:id/list, (0, 72), click, NULL): Clicking on the list does not navigate to a new page, but might trigger loading more items or opening an email given the interactive context of the email application. The same elements appear before and after action, indicating no new widgets were introduced or no further action was taken.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, com.appple.app.email:layout/message_list_item, NULL, click, NULL): Click to open the selected email message. The page after clicking this control shows the detailed view of the email message, which includes components like the sender's badge with id "com.appple.app.email:id/contact_badge" and email subject with id "com.appple.app.email:id/subject".
ACTION (android.widget.QuickContactBadge, com.appple.app.email:id/contact_badge, (16, 87), click, NULL): Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, and no observable changes or new widgets are detected in the Next Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.appple.app.email:id/subject, (6, 127), click, "ICSTSuperCool"): Clicking on the subject field in the compose email page opens the inbox item with the title "Another rabbit hole". This action navigates from the compose email page to the detailed email view page. This new page has a variety of control options including "Previous", "Next", "Delete", "Send…" messages, and more options on "com.appple.app.email:id/single_message_options". This could be for the purpose of reviewing/editing this specific email.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.appple.app.email:id/date, (273, 78), click, "Aug 8"): Click to view the message details. After clicking, the page shows full message details including sender "tm auto", "To:" field, message date "Aug 8, 2024, 19:42", and the text "Another rabbit hole".

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Given the input, the first step in the source test case is to verify the presence of the "Inbox" label. We will look for a corresponding action in the current page's intentions that matches this functionality.

The intention that corresponds to verifying the "Inbox" label is:
```
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.appple.app.email:id/actionbar_title_first, (49, 26), click, "Inbox"): Click to navigate to the inbox view.
```

Since we're verifying the presence of the "Inbox" label, we need an assertion rather than a navigation action. However, the provided intention indicates that clicking the element with id `com.appple.app.email:id/actionbar_title_first` will navigate to the inbox view, which implicitly confirms the presence of the "Inbox" label. Therefore, the corresponding action for the first step of the source test case will be an assertion on this element.

Here is the output for the first step of the test migration:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.appple.app.email:id/actionbar_title_first, (49, 26), "Inbox"): Verify that the 'Inbox' label is present.
~~~
Based on your input format for action transformation, here is the corresponding UIAutomator2 code for the Android device action described. We are using coordinates to perform the click action:

#### Output (The code should be wrapped using '···'):

```
d.click(49, 26)
```

For the assert operation provided, there's no need to convert it into UIAutomator2 code. However, for demonstration purposes, if that was required, the code would look like this:

#### Output for assertion (not requested):

```
assert d(resourceId="com.appple.app.email:id/actionbar_title_first").get_text() == "Inbox"
``` 

Since this is an action conversion request, I've only included the necessary code for the action.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided information, the source test case has started with verifying the presence of the "Inbox" label and then proceeds to the creation and sending of an email. The executed action sequence indicates that the "Inbox" label has been successfully verified in the target app.

The next step in the source test case is to click on the 'New Message' button to start composing a new email. Looking at the current page's intent description, the corresponding action for composing a new email in the target app is:

```
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.appple.app.email:id/compose, (192, 592), click, NULL): Clicking 'Compose' initiates the email composition screen, allowing you to enter To, Subject, and Message Text.
```

Since this is the next logical step in the test case migration, the appropriate action to perform would be to click on the 'Compose' button in the target app. Here is the response in the required output format:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.appple.app.email:id/compose, (192, 592), click, NULL): Initiate email composition
