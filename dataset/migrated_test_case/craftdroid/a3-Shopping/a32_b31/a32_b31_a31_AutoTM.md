#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The current page appears to be the initial login/signup page of the target app (Geek). Let's start with the first step of the source test case:

~~~
ASSERT (TextView, com.contextlogic.geek:id/login_fragment_create_account_button, (170, 801), wait_until_element_presence):Verify that the "Create Account" button is present
ACTION (TextView, com.contextlogic.geek:id/login_fragment_create_account_button, (170, 801), click, NULL):Click on the "Create Account" button to start the account creation process
~~~

This response corresponds to steps 1 and 2 of the source test case. We've adapted it to the target app by:
1. Asserting the presence of the "Create Account" button instead of "New? Create an Account".
2. Clicking on the "Create Account" button to initiate the account creation process.

The assertion ensures that we're on the correct page before proceeding, and the action mimics the behavior of starting the account creation process in the source app.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given actions:

```
# Verify that the "Create Account" button is present
assert d(resourceId="com.contextlogic.geek:id/login_fragment_create_account_button").exists()

# Click on the "Create Account" button
d.click(170, 801)
```

This code first asserts the presence of the "Create Account" button using its resource ID, and then clicks on it using the provided coordinates. The coordinate-based click is preferred as per the instructions, even though we have the resource ID available.

Based on the provided information, it appears we are at the beginning of the account creation process. The next step in the source test case is to input the email address. Let's proceed with this step:

~~~
ACTION (EditText, com.contextlogic.geek:id/create_account_fragment_email_text, (20, 297), input, "autotm9785760@gmail.com"):Input the email address "autotm9785760@gmail.com" into the email field
~~~

This action corresponds to step 4 in the source test case. We're using the email input field on the current page to enter the email address. The ID and coordinates match the information provided in the current page's intent description.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d.click(20, 297)
d.send_keys("autotm9785760@gmail.com")
```

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (20, 297) where the email input field is located, and then sends the email address "autotm9785760@gmail.com" to the input field.

Based on the provided information, we can see that the test case migration has progressed to the point where the email address has been entered. The next logical step in the source test case is to input the password. Let's proceed with that action:

~~~
ACTION (EditText, com.contextlogic.geek:id/create_account_fragment_password_text, (20, 506), input, "1qaz2wsX"):Input the password "1qaz2wsX" into the password field
~~~

This action corresponds to step 5 in the source test case. We're using the same password as in the original test case. The element ID and coordinates match those provided in the current page's intent description for the password field.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the action:

```
d.click(20, 506)
d.send_keys("1qaz2wsX")
```

This code first clicks on the password field using the provided coordinates (20, 506), and then inputs the password "1qaz2wsX" using the send_keys method.

Based on the provided information and the executed action sequence, it appears that we are in the process of creating a new account. The next steps in the source test case involve inputting the last name and first name. Let's proceed with these steps:

~~~
ACTION (EditText, com.contextlogic.geek:id/create_account_fragment_last_name_text, (370, 196), input, "Labfellow"):Input the last name "Labfellow" into the last name field
ACTION (EditText, com.contextlogic.geek:id/create_account_fragment_first_name_text, (20, 196), input, "Sealbot"):Input the first name "Sealbot" into the first name field
~~~

I've chosen these actions because:

1. They align with steps 6 and 7 of the source test case.
2. The current page's intent description includes EditText fields for both first name and last name, which match the required inputs.
3. We're following the logical flow of the account creation process.

Note that I've switched the order of last name and first name inputs to match the layout of the current page (last name field appears before first name field in the intent description). This is an example of adapting to the target app's specific layout while maintaining the overall functionality of the test case.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given actions:

```
d.click(370, 196)
d.send_keys("Labfellow")

d.click(20, 196)
d.send_keys("Sealbot")
```

This code follows the guidelines you've provided:
1. It uses the device variable name 'd' as specified.
2. It prioritizes using coordinates for interactions.
3. For text input, it first clicks on the coordinates of the input field, then uses send_keys to input the text.
4. The actions are performed in the order they were listed in the input.

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully completed steps 1 through 7 of the source test case. The next step in the source test case is to click the "Create an Account" button. Let's proceed with this step:

~~~
ACTION (TextView, com.contextlogic.geek:id/create_account_fragment_create_account_button, (20, 607), click, NULL):Click on the "Create Account" button to submit the form and create a new account
~~~

This action corresponds to step 8 in the source test case. We're using the element from the current page's intent description that matches the purpose of creating an account. After this action, we should wait for the confirmation or next step in the account creation process.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d.click(20, 607)

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have completed the account creation process, but encountered an error message. After addressing the error by re-entering all the information and clicking the "Create Account" button again, we should now proceed to the next step in the source test case. Let's continue with the migration:

~~~
ASSERT (TextView, com.contextlogic.geek:id/signup_flow_footer_button, (), wait_until_element_presence):Verify that the "Finish" button is present within 20 seconds
ACTION (TextView, com.contextlogic.geek:id/signup_flow_footer_button, (), click, NULL):Click on the "Finish" button to complete the account creation process
~~~

This response corresponds to steps 9 and 10 in the source test case. We're verifying the presence of the "Finish" button and then clicking it to complete the account creation process. If these elements are not found or the actions fail, we may need to adjust our approach in the next iteration.
Based on the provided actions, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

```
# Assert that the "Finish" button is present within 20 seconds
d(resourceId="com.contextlogic.geek:id/signup_flow_footer_button").wait(timeout=20.0)

# Click on the "Finish" button
d(resourceId="com.contextlogic.geek:id/signup_flow_footer_button").click()
```

This code first waits for the "Finish" button to be present for up to 20 seconds, then clicks on it. Since specific coordinates weren't provided, I used the resourceId to locate and interact with the element.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully completed most of the account creation process, but encountered an issue when trying to click the "Finish" button. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next step:

1. We've successfully filled out all the required fields for account creation.
2. We've clicked the "Create Account" button, and it seems the account was created successfully (as we reached the "Finish" button step).
3. The "Finish" button was detected on the screen (ASSERT was successful).
4. However, clicking the "Finish" button failed (Exec_Fail).

Given that the "Finish" button was detected but couldn't be clicked, we should try an alternative approach. Let's attempt to click the "Finish" button again, but this time we'll use the coordinates provided in the current page's intent description (if available) or try a different action like a long click.

Here's the next step I propose:

~~~
ACTION (TextView, com.contextlogic.geek:id/signup_flow_footer_button, (102, 864), click, NULL):Attempt to click the "Finish" button again using specific coordinates
~~~

This action attempts to click the "Finish" button again, but this time using the coordinates that were successful for the "OK" button in the error dialog. If this action is successful, we can proceed to the next step of the test case. If it fails, we may need to explore other options or check if there are any overlaying elements preventing the click.
Based on the provided information and requirements, I'll convert the given action into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the conversion:

···
d.click(102, 864)
···

This code uses the coordinates (102, 864) to click on the "Finish" button, as specified in the action description. Using coordinates is the preferred method according to the requirements, so this approach is optimal for the given scenario.

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully completed the account creation process and clicked the "Finish" button. The next step in the source test case is to verify the presence of the "Open Menu" button and click on it. Let's proceed with that:

~~~
ASSERT (ImageButton, "", (0, 64), wait_until_element_presence):Verify that the "Open Menu" button is present within 10 seconds
ACTION (ImageButton, "", (0, 64), click, NULL):Click on the "Open Menu" button
~~~

This response aligns with steps 11 and 12 of the source test case. We're looking for the "Open Menu" button, which is typically represented by an ImageButton in the top-left corner of the screen. The coordinates (0, 64) in the current page's intent description match this expectation.

If this action is successful, we should then proceed to verify the profile name. If it fails, we may need to explore alternative methods to access the user profile or menu.
I understand. I'll convert the given actions into UIAutomator2 code using Python, focusing on coordinates when available and following the specified format. Here's the converted code:

···
d(className="android.widget.ImageButton").wait(timeout=10.0)
d.click(0, 64)
···

This code does the following:
1. Waits for the ImageButton to be present for up to 10 seconds.
2. Clicks on the coordinates (0, 64) where the "Open Menu" button is located.

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully created an account and are now at a stage where we need to verify the login. The next step in the source test case is to verify the profile name. Let's proceed with that:

~~~
ASSERT (TextView, com.contextlogic.geek:id/menu_profile_name, (), wait_until_text_presence, "Sealbot"):Verify that the profile name containing "Sealbot" is present within 10 seconds
~~~

This assertion aims to confirm that the account creation process was successful by checking for the presence of the user's first name "Sealbot" in the profile section of the menu. If this assertion passes, we can consider the test case migration complete.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given assertion:

```
assert d(resourceId="com.contextlogic.geek:id/menu_profile_name", text="Sealbot").wait(timeout=10), "Profile name 'Sealbot' not found within 10 seconds"
```

This code performs the following:

1. It uses the device variable name 'd' as specified.
2. It targets the TextView element with the resourceId "com.contextlogic.geek:id/menu_profile_name".
3. It checks for the presence of the text "Sealbot" within this element.
4. It waits for up to 10 seconds for the text to appear (as implied by the "wait_until_text_presence" instruction).
5. If the text doesn't appear within 10 seconds, an assertion error will be raised with the message "Profile name 'Sealbot' not found within 10 seconds".

This code adheres to the UIAutomator2 syntax and meets the requirement of verifying the presence of the specified text within the given timeout period.

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully completed all the steps in the source test case. Let's confirm this and conclude the test migration:

~~~
ASSERT (TextView, com.contextlogic.geek:id/menu_profile_name, (), wait_until_text_presence, "Sealbot"):Verify that the profile name containing "Sealbot" is present within 10 seconds
DONE
~~~

Explanation:
1. We have successfully created an account with the provided information (email, password, first name, last name).
2. We navigated through the signup flow, including handling an error message and re-entering information.
3. We completed the account creation process by clicking the "Finish" button.
4. We verified the presence of the "Open Menu" button and clicked it.
5. Finally, we confirmed that the profile name "Sealbot" is present in the menu, which was the last step in the source test case.

All steps from the source test case have been successfully migrated to the target app, with some adaptations made for the specific UI and flow of the target app. Therefore, we can conclude the test migration by asserting the presence of the profile name and marking it as DONE.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the assertion:

```
assert d(resourceId="com.contextlogic.geek:id/menu_profile_name", text="Sealbot").wait(timeout=10), "Profile name 'Sealbot' not found within 10 seconds"
```

This code:
1. Looks for an element with the resource ID "com.contextlogic.geek:id/menu_profile_name" and text "Sealbot".
2. Waits for up to 10 seconds for this element to appear.
3. Raises an assertion error if the element is not found within the timeout period.

The `wait()` method is used here to implement the "wait_until_text_presence" functionality, as UIAutomator2 doesn't have a direct equivalent for this specific wait condition.
