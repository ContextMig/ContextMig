Based on the executed action sequence, the current step of the test migration is the verification of successful login. In the source test case, this is done by asserting the presence of the user's profile name 'Sealbot'. 

Looking at the current page's intentions, the closest match to this step is the action on the TextView with id 'com.contextlogic.wish:id/menu_profile_name'. This action navigates to the profile details page, where the user's profile name is displayed.

So, the next step in the test migration would be to assert the presence of the user's profile name 'Sealbot' on the TextView with id 'com.contextlogic.wish:id/menu_profile_name'. 

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.contextlogic.wish:id/menu_profile_name, (176, 132), wait_until_text_presence, "text:Sealbot"): Verify that the text 'Sealbot' is present within 10 seconds, indicating successful login.
~~~
Based on the given details, the provided assertion is intended to confirm the presence of the text 'Sealbot' within 10 seconds to indicate a successful login action.

Here is the UIAutomator2 code snippet in Python:

···
import time
start_time = time.time()
while time.time() - start_time < 10:
    if d(resourceId="com.contextlogic.wish:id/menu_profile_name").get_text() == "Sealbot":
        break
    time.sleep(1)
assert(d(resourceId="com.contextlogic.wish:id/menu_profile_name").get_text() == "Sealbot")
···

In this code, we have a loop that checks every second if the text is 'Sealbot', and if the condition is met, it breaks the loop. After the loop (and thus after waiting for at most 10 seconds), we assert that the text indeed is 'Sealbot'. If the text is not 'Sealbot' after 10 seconds, an AssertionError will be raised.
