#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The current page appears to be the sign-in page of the target application. Let's start with the first step of the source test case.

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.Button, com.contextlogic.wish:id/signInButton, (32, 803), wait_until_element_presence):Verify that the "Sign In" button is present
~~~

This assertion corresponds to step 1 of the source test case, where we verify the presence of the "Sign In" button. The element is present on the current page, so we can proceed with the next step, which is clicking the "Sign In" button.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code to verify the presence of the "Sign In" button:

```
assert d(resourceId="com.contextlogic.wish:id/signInButton").exists(timeout=10)
```

This code checks if the "Sign In" button with the specified resource ID exists within a 10-second timeout period. The `exists()` method with a timeout parameter is used to implement the `wait_until_element_presence` functionality.

Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case has been completed, which was verifying the presence of the "Sign In" button. Now, we need to proceed with the next step, which is clicking the "Sign In" button. However, in the target app, we need to input the email and password before clicking the "Sign In" button. So, we'll adjust the order slightly to match the target app's flow.

Here's the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.contextlogic.wish:id/emailText, (32, 550), input, "autotm7677@gmail.com"):Input the email address for sign-in
~~~

This action corresponds to step 5 in the source test case, but we're performing it earlier in the target app to match the layout and flow of the current page.
Based on the given information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code for the specified action:

```
d.click(32, 550)
d.send_keys("autotm7677@gmail.com")
```

This code first clicks on the EditText field at the specified coordinates (32, 550) and then inputs the email address "autotm7677@gmail.com" into that field.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll continue with the next step in the test case migration. Here's my response:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.contextlogic.wish:id/passwordText, (32, 646), input, "1qaz2wsX"):Input the password for sign-in
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already verified the presence of the "Sign In" button and input the email address in the previous steps.
2. The next logical step in the source test case is to input the password.
3. In the current page's intent description, we have an EditText element with the id "com.contextlogic.wish:id/passwordText" which corresponds to the password field.
4. The action to perform is inputting the password "1qaz2wsX" as specified in the source test case.

This step aligns with step 4 of the source test case, adapting it to the target application's structure. We're proceeding step-by-step, focusing on gradually matching each operation in the source test case to the target application.
Based on the provided information, I'll convert the action into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the code wrapped in triple backticks:

```
d.click(32, 646)
d.send_keys("1qaz2wsX")
```

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the EditText field at the coordinates (32, 646).
2. Inputs the password "1qaz2wsX" into the field.

I've used the coordinates as specified in the input, which is the preferred method according to the requirements.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.contextlogic.wish:id/signInButton, (32, 777), click, NULL):Click on the "Sign In" button to submit the login credentials
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already input the email and password in the previous steps.
2. The next logical step in the source test case (step 6) is to click the "Sign In" button to submit the credentials.
3. In the current page's intent description, we have a matching button with the ID "com.contextlogic.wish:id/signInButton" and the text "Sign In".
4. The action aligns with both the source test case and the available intentions on the current page.

This action should attempt to log the user in. After this, we'll need to verify if the login was successful in the next step.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d.click(32, 777)
```

This code uses the coordinates (32, 777) to click on the "Sign In" button, as specified in the action description. Since coordinates are provided and are the preferred method according to the requirements, we use them directly in the `click()` function.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully completed the login process in the target application. The next step in the source test case is to verify the successful login by checking for the presence of the "Open Menu" button and then clicking on it. However, the current page's intent description doesn't show an exact match for this element. Let's proceed with the closest matching action that aligns with our goal of verifying successful login.

~~~
ASSERT (android.view.ViewGroup, com.contextlogic.wish:id/bottom_nav_view, (0, 1488), wait_until_element_presence):Verify that the bottom navigation bar is present, indicating successful login
ACTION (android.view.ViewGroup, , (576, 1488), click, NULL):Click on the fifth navigation item, likely to access the user profile or settings screen
~~~

Explanation:
1. We first assert the presence of the bottom navigation bar, which serves as an indicator that the user has successfully logged in and is now on the main interface of the app.
2. Since we don't see an exact "Open Menu" button, we're using the fifth navigation item in the bottom bar, which is described as possibly leading to a user profile or settings screen. This action is functionally similar to opening a menu to view user information, as was done in the source test case.

These steps aim to verify successful login and navigate to a user-related section, which aligns with the intent of steps 7 and 8 in the source test case. We'll need to see the result of this action and the next page's intentions to determine how to proceed with verifying the user's profile name.
I understand. Based on the provided information and requirements, I'll convert the given actions into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the corresponding code:

···
# Verify bottom navigation bar presence
assert d(resourceId="com.contextlogic.wish:id/bottom_nav_view").exists(), "Bottom navigation bar not present"

# Click on the fifth navigation item
d.click(576, 1488)
···

This code first asserts the presence of the bottom navigation bar using its resource ID, which indicates successful login. Then, it clicks on the specified coordinates (576, 1488) to access the fifth navigation item, likely leading to the user profile or settings screen.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that the login process has been successfully completed, and we are now on the main screen of the app. The next step in the source test case is to verify the presence of the "Open Menu" button and click on it. However, the current app's layout seems different, with a bottom navigation bar instead of a side menu.

Let's proceed with the next logical step, which is to access the user profile or settings to verify the user's name. Here's the suggested next action:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (432, 1488), wait_until_element_presence):Verify that the profile/account navigation item is present
ACTION (android.view.ViewGroup, , (432, 1488), click, NULL):Click on the profile/account navigation item to access user information
~~~

This action attempts to navigate to the user profile or account section, where we can likely find the user's name to verify successful login. We're using the fourth item in the bottom navigation bar, which typically represents the user account in many apps.
I understand. Based on the provided actions, I'll convert them into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the translation:

```
# Verify that the profile/account navigation item is present
assert d(className="android.widget.TextView", x=432, y=1488).exists(timeout=10)

# Click on the profile/account navigation item to access user information
d.click(432, 1488)
```

This code first asserts the presence of the TextView at the specified coordinates and then performs a click action at the same location. The `exists()` method with a timeout ensures that the element is present before proceeding with the assertion. The click action is performed using the exact coordinates provided.

Based on the provided information, it appears that the user has successfully logged in and navigated to a page that might be the main screen or a profile-related screen. The next step in the source test case is to verify the presence of the "Open Menu" button and click on it. However, the current page's intent description doesn't show an exact match for this button. Let's try to find the closest equivalent action based on the available intentions.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, "", (56, 120), click, NULL):Click on the top-left button, which might serve as a menu or navigation button
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.contextlogic.wish:id/empty_message, (360, 345), wait_until_text_presence, "Your cart is empty"):Verify that the "Your cart is empty" message is present, indicating we're on a main or cart-related screen
~~~

Explanation:
1. We're clicking on the ImageButton at the top-left corner (56, 120), which often serves as a menu or navigation button in many apps. This action is similar to clicking the "Open Menu" button in the source test case.
2. We're then asserting the presence of the "Your cart is empty" message. While this isn't exactly matching the profile name verification in the source test case, it confirms that we've successfully navigated to a main screen after login.

These actions attempt to match steps 7 and 8 of the source test case. If this doesn't lead to the desired outcome, we may need to explore other options on this screen or navigate to a different screen to find the user profile information.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given actions:

```
d.click(56, 120)
assert d(resourceId="com.contextlogic.wish:id/empty_message").wait(text="Your cart is empty")
```

This code does the following:

1. Clicks on the top-left button at coordinates (56, 120).
2. Waits for and verifies the presence of the "Your cart is empty" message using the provided resource ID.

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully logged in and navigated to a main screen or cart-related screen. The next step in the source test case is to verify the user's profile name. However, we don't see a direct match for this in the current page's intentions. Let's try to navigate to a profile or account section where we might find this information.

~~~
ACTION (android.view.ViewGroup, , (576, 1488), click, NULL):Click on the rightmost navigation item, likely to access the user profile or account settings
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (0, 0), wait_until_element_presence):Verify that a profile or account-related page has loaded
~~~

This action attempts to navigate to the user profile or account settings page where we might find the user's name. After executing this action, we'll need to reassess the page intentions to locate the user's profile name or a similar identifier.
Based on the provided actions, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

```
d.click(576, 1488)
assert d(className="android.widget.TextView").exists(timeout=10)
```

This code does the following:
1. Clicks on the coordinates (576, 1488), which corresponds to the rightmost navigation item.
2. Asserts that a TextView element is present on the screen, waiting for up to 10 seconds for it to appear. This verifies that a profile or account-related page has loaded.

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully logged in and navigated to the user's profile or account settings page. The next step in the source test case is to verify the user's profile name. Let's proceed with this step:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.contextlogic.wish:id/menu_profile_name, (176, 132), wait_until_text_presence, "Sealbot"):Verify that the user's profile name containing "Sealbot" is present, confirming successful login
~~~

This assertion corresponds to step 9 in the source test case. We're verifying that the user's profile name is present and contains "Sealbot". The element ID and coordinates are taken from the current page's intent description.

If this assertion passes, we can consider the test case migration complete. If it fails, we may need to investigate further or consider alternative approaches to verify the successful login.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code to perform the assertion:

```
assert d(resourceId="com.contextlogic.wish:id/menu_profile_name", text="Sealbot").wait(timeout=10)
```

This code will:
1. Wait for up to 10 seconds for the element with the specified resource ID to appear and contain the text "Sealbot".
2. If the element is found within the timeout period, the assertion passes.
3. If the element is not found or doesn't contain the expected text, the assertion will fail.

The code uses the resourceId and text attributes to locate the element, as these are more reliable than coordinates for dynamic content. However, if you strictly prefer coordinates, you can use this alternative:

```
assert d(text="Sealbot").wait(timeout=10)
d.click(176, 132)
assert d(text="Sealbot").exists()
```

This alternative will:
1. Wait for any element with the text "Sealbot" to appear.
2. Click on the specified coordinates.
3. Verify that an element with the text "Sealbot" exists at that location.
