#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with selecting an item from a shopping list, while the current page of the target app shows a list of shopping lists. To proceed with the migration, we need to first select a shopping list to view its items. Here's the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListNameTextView, (58, 106), click, "grocery"):Click on the shopping list named "grocery" to view its contents and proceed with item selection
~~~

This action will navigate to the page containing the items of the selected shopping list, which aligns with the first step of the source test case where we need to interact with items in a shopping list.
Based on the given action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(58, 106)
···

This code clicks on the coordinates (58, 106) where the shopping list named "grocery" is located. Since precise coordinates are provided, we use them directly for the click action, as per the requirements.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Here's my response:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/item_list_view, (16, 80), click, NULL):Click on the first item in the shopping list
ASSERT (android.widget.CheckBox, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/itemCheckedCheckBox, (272, 86), isNotChecked):Verify that the checkbox is initially unchecked
ACTION (android.widget.CheckBox, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/itemCheckedCheckBox, (272, 86), click, NULL):Click on the checkbox to select the item
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already clicked on the "grocery" shopping list, which corresponds to step 1 in the source test case.
2. The next step is to select an item in the list. In the target app, we need to click on the ListView to select an item.
3. Before checking the item, we assert that it's initially unchecked to ensure we're starting from the correct state.
4. Finally, we click on the checkbox to select the item, which corresponds to step 2 in the source test case.

This approach combines steps 1 and 2 from the source test case, adapting to the structure of the target app. We've also added an assertion to ensure the initial state is correct before proceeding with the selection.
Based on the provided actions, I'll convert them into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the code wrapped in '···':

···
# Click on the first item in the shopping list
d.click(16, 80)

# Verify that the checkbox is initially unchecked
assert not d(resourceId="pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/itemCheckedCheckBox").info['checked']

# Click on the checkbox to select the item
d.click(272, 86)
···

This code follows the requirements and guidelines you provided:
1. It uses the device variable name 'd' as specified.
2. It prioritizes using coordinates for actions where available.
3. For the assertion, it uses the resourceId to check the checkbox state.
4. The code is concise and avoids redundancy.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll continue with the next step in the test case migration. Here's my analysis and recommendation:

1. We've successfully navigated to the grocery list and selected the first item by clicking on it.
2. We've verified that the checkbox was initially unchecked.
3. We've clicked on the checkbox to select the item.

The next logical step in our source test case is to verify that the checkbox is now checked. Let's proceed with this assertion:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.CheckBox, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/itemCheckedCheckBox, (272, 86), isChecked):Verify that the checkbox is now checked after selection
~~~

This assertion aligns with step 3 in our source test case: "ASSERT (CheckBox, R.id.checkbox_is_selected, (), isChecked): Verify that the checkbox is checked."

After this assertion, we should proceed to delete the selected item. In the source test case, this was done by clicking a delete button in the action bar and then a floating action button. However, in our target app, we don't see these exact elements. Instead, we have a "More options" button that might contain a delete function. Let's explore that next:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (280, 28), click, NULL):Click on "More options" to open the menu and look for delete options
~~~

This action will help us determine if there's a delete option available in the menu, which would correspond to steps 4 and 5 in our source test case.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, I'll convert them into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the code:

···
assert d(resourceId="pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/itemCheckedCheckBox").info['checked']
d.click(280, 28)
···

This code does the following:

1. The first line asserts that the checkbox with the given resource ID is checked. This verifies that the checkbox is now checked after selection.

2. The second line clicks on the "More options" button at the specified coordinates (280, 28) to open the menu and look for delete options.

Note that I've used the device variable name 'd' as specified in the input. The code uses coordinates for the click action as per the preference stated in the requirements. For the assertion, I've used the resource ID since it's provided and unique.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I can determine that we are currently at the step of deleting the selected items in the shopping list. Let's proceed with the next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/title, (136, 41), click, "Delete checked items"):Click to delete checked items from the shopping list
~~~

This action corresponds to steps 4 and 5 in the source test case, where we click on the delete button and then confirm the deletion. In the target app, it seems that these two steps are combined into a single action of clicking "Delete checked items".

After this action, we should verify that the items have been deleted. If the list becomes empty, we can consider the test case complete. If not, we may need to look for a confirmation dialog or check the list contents.
Based on the provided action and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to click the "Delete checked items" option:

```
d.click(136, 41)
```

This code uses the coordinates (136, 41) to perform the click action, which is the preferred method as per the requirements. The click operation will delete the checked items from the shopping list.

#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), click, NULL): Click the "Navigate up" button to return to the main page showing a list of shopping lists. The new page contains a ListView with id "pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shopping_lists_list_view" displaying multiple shopping lists, each with details like name, completion percentage, item count, and modification date.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click on the "Navigate up" button to return to the main shopping lists page. This action navigates to a page showing multiple shopping lists, with a ListView (id: pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shopping_lists_list_view) containing individual shopping list items.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (60, 38), click, "grocery"): Click on the "grocery" text to view or edit the grocery list. No new page or widgets appear after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (60, 38), long_click, "grocery"): Long-click on the "grocery" text to potentially open a context menu or perform an action related to the grocery list. No new page or dialog appears after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.FrameLayout, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/expand_activities_button, (167, 34), click, NULL): Click to open the share options. A new dialog appears with a list of sharing options including "Messaging", "New Message", "Mail to Self", and "See all".
ACTION (android.widget.FrameLayout, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/expand_activities_button, (167, 34), long_click, NULL): Long click to open a sharing options menu. The new page displays a list of sharing options including "Messaging", "New Message", "Mail to Self", and "See all".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/image, (179, 36), click, NULL): Click to open the share menu. This action opens a popup menu with sharing options including "Messaging", "New Message", "Mail to Self", and a "See all" option to view more sharing methods.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/image, (179, 36), long_click, NULL): Long click on the share button to open a sharing menu. The next page shows a list of sharing options including "Messaging", "New Message", "Mail to Self", and "See all" with corresponding clickable elements.
ACTION (android.widget.FrameLayout, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/default_activity_button, (224, 34), click, NULL): Click to share the shopping list. The action doesn't lead to a new page, but likely triggers a sharing functionality or opens a sharing dialog.
ACTION (android.widget.FrameLayout, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/default_activity_button, (224, 34), long_click, NULL): Long click to open a share menu. The next page shows a list of apps to share with, including options like "Note Now", "Messaging", and "New Message".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (280, 28), click, NULL): Click to open more options. This action opens a popup menu with options including "Delete checked items" and "Sort...".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (280, 28), long_click, NULL): Long click to open more options menu. The action doesn't lead to a new page, but may trigger a popup menu with additional options for the grocery list.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/empty_listview_textview, (16, 80), click, "You have no items on the list. Add one using the button below."): Click on the empty list view text. No change occurs as the next page JSON is identical to the current page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/empty_listview_textview, (16, 80), longClick, "You have no items on the list. Add one using the button below."): Long click on the empty list view text. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes in the UI.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/fab, (238, 558), click, NULL): Click to open the "Add item" page, which contains an input field for item name (id: pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/item_name_edit_text), quantity controls, unit selection radio buttons, and a "SAVE" button (id: pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/addShoppingListButton).

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case semantics, I can determine that we have successfully completed steps 1, 2, and 3 of the source test case. We have selected an item in the shopping list and verified that it's checked. The next step in the source test case is to delete the selected item.

In the target app, we've already clicked on the "More options" menu and selected "Delete checked items". This action combines steps 4 and 5 from the source test case. The next logical step would be to confirm the deletion, which corresponds to step 6 in the source test case.

However, the current page's intent description doesn't show a confirmation dialog. It's possible that the deletion happens immediately without confirmation in this app. To ensure we've completed the test case, we should verify that the item has been deleted.

Here's the next action I propose:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.ListView, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/item_list_view, (16, 80), isEmpty):Verify that the shopping list is now empty after deleting the checked item
DONE
~~~

This assertion checks if the ListView is now empty, which would confirm that the deletion was successful. If this assertion passes, we can consider the test case migration complete, as we've covered all the steps from the source test case:
1. Selecting an item
2. Checking the checkbox
3. Verifying the checkbox is checked
4. Initiating the delete action
5. Confirming the deletion (in this case, by selecting "Delete checked items")
6. Verifying the deletion was successful

If the assertion fails, we may need to explore other options or consider if there are any additional steps required in the target app to complete the deletion process.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
assert d(resourceId="pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/item_list_view").child(className="android.widget.ListView").count == 0
···

This code checks if the ListView with the given resource ID is empty, which verifies that the shopping list is now empty after deleting the checked item.
