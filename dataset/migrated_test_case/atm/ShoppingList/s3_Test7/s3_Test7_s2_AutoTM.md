#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. Let's start with the first step of the source test case:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, br.com.activity:id/lvShoppingList, (5, 77), click, NULL):Click on the first item in the shopping list
~~~

This action corresponds to step 1 in the source test case, which is clicking on the first item in the shopping list. The target app has a similar ListView element with the same purpose, so we can use it for this step.
Based on the given information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code for the specified action:

···
d.click(5, 77)
···

This code uses the coordinates (5, 77) to click on the first item in the shopping list, as specified in the action description. Using coordinates is preferred when they are precise, which is the case here.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Here's my analysis and recommendation:

1. We've successfully clicked on the first item in the shopping list, which corresponds to step 1 in the source test case.

2. The next step in the source test case is to click on the checkbox to select the item. However, in the target app, we don't see a direct checkbox option in the current page's intentions.

3. Instead, we see that clicking on a list item opens its details page, which might include options for selecting or modifying the item.

Given this, here's the next recommended action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/nameShoppingList, (45, 82), click, "Untitled"):Click on the "Untitled" shopping list item to open its details page
~~~

This action should open the details page of the selected item, where we might find options to select or delete the item, corresponding to the next steps in our source test case.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d.click(45, 82)
···

This code uses the coordinates (45, 82) to click on the "Untitled" shopping list item, which should open its details page. The coordinate-based approach is preferred as per the requirements, and it's the most precise way to interact with the specific element.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (0, 24), click, "Untitled"): Click on the "Untitled, Navigate up" button to return to the main Shopping List page. The next page shows a list of shopping lists with their names, dates, and times.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (0, 24), long_click, "Untitled"): Long click on the navigation bar to return to the Shopping List page. The page after this action contains a ListView with id "br.com.activity:id/lvShoppingList" displaying multiple shopping lists.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/action_bar_title, (49, 35), click, "Untitled"): Click on the title "Untitled" to return to the main shopping list page. The next page shows a list of shopping lists with the title "Shopping List" and includes a "New list" button with id "br.com.activity:id/action_add".

ACTION (android.widget.EditText, br.com.activity:id/edDescription, (5, 77), long_click, "Add an item"): Long click on the "Add an item" input field. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes in the UI.
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, br.com.activity:id/lvItemShoppingList, (5, 117), click, NULL): Click on the empty shopping list. No new page or widgets appear, as the list remains empty with the "No item was added" message.
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, br.com.activity:id/lvItemShoppingList, (5, 117), long_click, NULL): Long click on the empty shopping list to potentially trigger options for adding items or managing the list. No new page or dialog appears, suggesting the action might not have an effect on an empty list.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/header_description_collumn, (15, 127), click, "No item was added"): Click on the "No item was added" text. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes in the UI elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/header_description_collumn, (15, 127), long_click, "No item was added"): Long click on the "No item was added" text. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed actions and the source test case, we are currently at step 1 of the test case, which is to select an item in the shopping list. However, the target app seems to have a different structure, where we first need to select a shopping list before we can interact with its items. Let's proceed with the next logical step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, br.com.activity:id/edDescription, (5, 77), click, "Add an item"):Click to focus on the text input field for adding a new item to the shopping list
~~~

This action aligns with the intention of adding an item to the shopping list, which is necessary before we can select and delete it as per the source test case. We're adapting the test case to the target app's structure while maintaining the overall goal of testing item selection and deletion.
Based on the given action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

```
d.click(5, 77)
d(resourceId="br.com.activity:id/edDescription").set_text("Add an item")
```

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (5, 77) to focus on the text input field, and then uses the resourceId to set the text "Add an item" in the input field.

This action doesn't navigate to a new page, but it adds a new item "Add an item" to the shopping list, which appears with id "br.com.activity:id/descriptionItemShoppingList".

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the stage of selecting an item in the shopping list. Let's proceed with the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, br.com.activity:id/lvItemShoppingList, (5, 117), click, NULL):Click on the first item in the shopping list to select it
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already opened a specific shopping list and focused on the input field for adding items.
2. The next step in the source test case is to select an item in the list.
3. In the target app, we don't see a specific checkbox for selection, but we can click on the list item itself to select it.
4. The ListView with id "br.com.activity:id/lvItemShoppingList" represents the shopping list items, so we'll click on it to select the first item.

This action corresponds to steps 1 and 2 in the source test case, as it combines the actions of clicking on the list item and selecting it. After this action, we should be able to proceed with verifying the selection and then moving on to the deletion process.
Based on the provided action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to click on the first item in the shopping list:

···
d.click(5, 117)
···

This code uses the precise coordinates (5, 117) provided in the action description to perform the click operation. Using coordinates is the optimal choice as per the requirements, and it directly interacts with the first item in the shopping list without relying on specific IDs or text content.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've clicked on a shopping list item.
2. We've opened the details of the "Untitled" shopping list.
3. We've focused on the text input field for adding a new item.
4. We've clicked on the first item in the shopping list to select it.

The next step in the source test case is to click on the checkbox to select the item. However, in the target app, we don't see a direct checkbox. Instead, we've already clicked on the item itself. This might be equivalent to selecting the item in the target app.

Given this, let's proceed with the next logical step, which would be to verify if the item is selected and then move on to the deletion process.

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.ListView, br.com.activity:id/lvItemShoppingList, (5, 117), isSelected):Verify that the item in the shopping list is selected

ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (264, 24), click, NULL):Click on "More options" to open a menu with options including deletion
~~~

This response assumes that the item selection is done by clicking on it (which we've already done), and now we're moving to open the options menu to find the delete function. The assertion checks if the item is indeed selected, and the action opens the menu where we expect to find the delete option.
I understand. Based on the provided information, I'll convert the given actions into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the code wrapped in triple backticks:

```
assert d(resourceId="br.com.activity:id/lvItemShoppingList").child(className="android.widget.ListView").child(index=0).selected()

d.click(264, 24)
```

This code does the following:

1. Asserts that the first item in the shopping list (ListView) is selected.
2. Clicks on the "More options" button located at coordinates (264, 24).

I've used coordinates for the click action as specified in the requirements. For the assertion, I've used the resourceId and child elements to locate the specific item in the ListView.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've clicked on a shopping list item, opened its details, focused on the input field, selected an item in the list, and verified its selection.
2. We've also clicked on the "More options" button, which likely opens a menu with various options.

The next logical step in our source test case is to delete the selected item. In the target app, we need to find an option that allows us to delete the checked/selected items. From the current page's intentions, we can see there's a "Delete checked" option available.

Here's the next step in our migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (132, 181), click, "Delete checked"):Click to open a confirmation dialog for deleting checked items
~~~

This action corresponds to step 4 and 5 in our source test case (clicking the delete button and the floating action button to delete selected products). In the target app, these actions seem to be combined into a single "Delete checked" option.
Based on the provided action and device variable name, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(132, 181)
···

This code uses the coordinates (132, 181) to perform a click action, which should open the confirmation dialog for deleting checked items. I've used the coordinate-based approach as per the requirements, since precise coordinates were provided in the input.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (32, 250), click, "Excluir?"): Click on the alert title. No navigation occurs as the same confirmation dialog remains open with "Yes" and "No" buttons (android:id/button1 and android:id/button2).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (32, 250), long_click, "Excluir?"): Long click on the alert title. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (16, 299), click, "Do you want to delete all the checked items of this shopping lists?"): Click to view the confirmation message. No new page or widgets appear after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (16, 299), long_click, "Do you want to delete all the checked items of this shopping lists?"): Long click on the confirmation message. No new page or dialog appears, as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (16, 383), click, "No"): Click on "No" button to cancel the deletion of checked items. This action dismisses the confirmation dialog and returns to the shopping list page with items unchanged.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (16, 383), long_click, "No"): Long click on "No" button to dismiss the deletion confirmation dialog. The page after this action returns to the shopping list view with an "Add item" button (id: br.com.activity:id/action_done) and an "Add an item" input field (id: br.com.activity:id/edDescription).
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (160, 383), click, "Yes"): Click to confirm deletion of checked items. After clicking, the page returns to the shopping list view where the checked items have been removed. The page contains an "Add item" button with id "br.com.activity:id/action_done" and an editable text field with id "br.com.activity:id/edDescription" for adding new items.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (160, 383), long_click, "Yes"): Long click on the "Yes" button to confirm deletion of checked items in the shopping list. This action returns to the main shopping list view, where the "Add an item" input field (id: br.com.activity:id/edDescription) and the shopping list (id: br.com.activity:id/lvItemShoppingList) are visible.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at step 6 of the source test case, which involves confirming the deletion of selected items. The executed action sequence shows that we have already selected an item, opened the options menu, and clicked on "Delete checked". Now, we need to confirm the deletion in the target app. Let's proceed with the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (160, 383), click, NULL):Click on the "Yes" button to confirm deletion of checked items
~~~

This action corresponds to step 6 in the source test case, where we click the "Okay" button to confirm the deletion. In the target app, we're clicking the "Yes" button, which serves the same purpose of confirming the deletion of checked items.
Based on the given action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

```
d.click(160, 383)
```

This code uses the coordinates (160, 383) to click on the "Yes" button to confirm the deletion of checked items. The coordinate-based approach is preferred as per the requirements, and it's the most precise way to interact with the specific UI element in this case.

Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've selected an item in the shopping list.
2. We've verified that the item is selected.
3. We've opened the "More options" menu and selected "Delete checked".
4. We've confirmed the deletion of checked items.

The next logical step in the source test case would be to verify that the item has been deleted. However, the target app might handle this differently. Let's proceed with an appropriate action based on the current page's intentions.

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.ListView, br.com.activity:id/lvItemShoppingList, (5, 117), isEmpty):Verify that the shopping list is empty after deleting the checked item
~~~

This assertion checks if the shopping list is now empty after the deletion. If this assertion fails, it might mean that either the deletion wasn't successful or that the list wasn't emptied as expected. In that case, we might need to take a different approach in the next step.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to verify that the shopping list is empty after deleting the checked item:

···
assert d(resourceId="br.com.activity:id/lvItemShoppingList").child(className="android.widget.ListView").count == 0
···

This code checks if the ListView with the given resource ID has no child elements, effectively verifying that the shopping list is empty.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll continue the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next step:

1. We've already selected an item in the shopping list, confirmed its selection, and deleted it.
2. The last assertion confirms that the shopping list is now empty.

The next logical step in the source test case would be to add a new item to the list. However, the source test case doesn't explicitly include this step. Therefore, we'll focus on ensuring that the deletion process is complete and the list remains empty.

Here's the next action I propose:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.ListView, br.com.activity:id/lvItemShoppingList, (5, 117), isEmpty):Verify that the shopping list remains empty after deletion
~~~

This assertion will confirm that the deletion process was successful and that no items have been unexpectedly added to the list.
Based on the provided action and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to verify that the shopping list remains empty after deletion:

···
assert d(resourceId="br.com.activity:id/lvItemShoppingList").child(className="android.widget.LinearLayout").exists() == False
···

This code checks if the ListView with the given resource ID has any child elements. If it doesn't have any children, it means the list is empty, which satisfies the assertion requirement.

The dialog contains a title "Excluir?", a message asking to confirm deletion, and two buttons: "No" (id: android:id/button2) and "Yes" (id: android:id/button1).

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated most of the steps from the source test case to the target application. Let's review the progress and determine the next action:

1. We've clicked on the first item in the shopping list.
2. We've selected an item (although through a different method than the checkbox in the source).
3. We've verified the selection (through asserting isSelected instead of isChecked).
4. We've clicked on a delete option (through the "More options" menu instead of a direct delete button).
5. We've confirmed the deletion (by clicking "Yes" in a confirmation dialog).
6. We've verified that the item was deleted (by asserting that the list is empty).

It seems that we have covered all the main steps of the source test case. However, to ensure completeness, let's add one more assertion to double-check that the list remains empty after deletion. After that, we can conclude the test case migration.

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.ListView, br.com.activity:id/lvItemShoppingList, (5, 117), isEmpty):Verify that the shopping list remains empty after deletion
DONE
~~~

This final assertion confirms that the deletion was permanent and no items reappeared in the list. With this, we have successfully migrated all steps of the source test case to the target application, accounting for the differences in UI and interaction methods between the two apps.
Based on the provided action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
assert d(resourceId="br.com.activity:id/lvItemShoppingList").child(className="android.widget.ListView").count == 0
···

This code verifies that the shopping list is empty by checking if the ListView with the specified resource ID has no child elements. If the count is 0, it means the list is empty, which satisfies the assertion condition.
