#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to long-click on the first item in the shopping list, which aligns with the action that has just been executed successfully. Now, we need to proceed with the next step, which is to click on the first item in the context menu that appears after the long click. However, the current page's intentions don't explicitly mention a context menu. Let's try to find the most appropriate action based on the available information.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListNameTextView, (58, 106), longClick, "ggt"): Long press on the shopping list item to open a context menu with options to Edit, Delete, and Share the selected list.
~~~

This action seems to be the most relevant to our current situation. It opens a context menu with options including "Edit", which is likely what we need for renaming the shopping list. The next step would be to select the "Edit" option from this context menu.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d.long_click(58, 106, 1)
···

This code performs a long click action at the coordinates (58, 106) for 1 second, which should open the context menu for the shopping list item as described in the action.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (74, 120), click, "ggt"): Click on the shopping list title. This action does not navigate to a new page, but displays a popup menu with options to Edit, Delete, and Share the selected shopping list.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (74, 120), long_click, "ggt"): Long click on the shopping list title to open a context menu with options to Edit, Delete, or Share the list.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (58, 154), click, NULL): Click to edit the shopping list. This action does not navigate to a new page, but remains on the same options menu with "Edit", "Delete", and "Share" options.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (58, 154), long_click, NULL): Long click to open a context menu with options to Edit, Delete, and Share the selected shopping list item.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently at step 2 of the source test case, where we need to select the rename option from the context menu. Let's proceed with the next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (58, 154), click, NULL): Click to edit the shopping list. This action selects the "Edit" option from the context menu to rename the shopping list.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 in the source test case, where we click on the first item in the context menu that appears after the long click. In this case, we're selecting the "Edit" option to rename the shopping list.
Based on the given action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(58, 154)
···

This code will perform a click action at the coordinates (58, 154) to edit the shopping list. The action uses the exact coordinates provided, which is the preferred method as per the requirements.

ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), click, NULL): Click to open navigation drawer, revealing options like Settings, Tell a friend, Rate me, and Contact the author.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click to open navigation drawer. The action does not navigate to a new page or show new widgets.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (60, 38), click, "Your shopping lists"): Click on the title "Your shopping lists". This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the page content remains the same after the interaction.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (60, 38), long_click, "Your shopping lists"): Long click on the title to open options menu. No new page or dialog appears, indicating the action had no visible effect in this context.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/empty_listview_textview, (16, 96), click, "You have no shopping lists. Add one using the button below."): Click on the empty list view text. This action does not lead to a new page or create new widgets, as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/empty_listview_textview, (16, 96), long_click, "You have no shopping lists. Add one using the button below."): Long click on the empty list view text. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the Current Page JSON and Next Page JSON are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/fab, (238, 558), click, NULL): Click to open the "Add Shopping List" page, which contains an EditText for shopping list name with id "pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListNameEditText", an EditText for description with id "pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListDescriptionEditText", and a save button with id "pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/addShoppingListButton".

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I can see that we are currently at the step of renaming a shopping list item. The executed actions so far align with the first two steps of the source test case. Let's proceed with the next step in the migration process.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListNameEditText, (16, 96), input, "new-list"): Input the new name "new-list" into the edit text field for renaming the shopping list.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in the source test case, where we input the new name for the shopping list. I've used the EditText field with the id "pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListNameEditText" as it's likely to be the field for entering the shopping list name based on the current page's intent description.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(16, 96)
d(resourceId="pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListNameEditText").set_text("new-list")
···

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (16, 96) to focus on the edit text field, and then uses the resourceId to set the text "new-list" in the shopping list name edit text.

ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), click, NULL): Click to open navigation drawer, revealing options like Settings, Tell a friend, Rate me, and Contact the author.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click to open navigation drawer. The action does not navigate to a new page or show new widgets.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (60, 38), click, "Your shopping lists"): Click on the title "Your shopping lists". This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the page content remains the same after the interaction.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (60, 38), long_click, "Your shopping lists"): Long click on the title to open options menu. No new page or dialog appears, indicating the action had no visible effect in this context.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/empty_listview_textview, (16, 96), click, "You have no shopping lists. Add one using the button below."): Click on the empty list view text. This action does not lead to a new page or create new widgets, as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/empty_listview_textview, (16, 96), long_click, "You have no shopping lists. Add one using the button below."): Long click on the empty list view text. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the Current Page JSON and Next Page JSON are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/fab, (238, 558), click, NULL): Click to open the "Add Shopping List" page, which contains an EditText for shopping list name with id "pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListNameEditText", an EditText for description with id "pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListDescriptionEditText", and a save button with id "pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/addShoppingListButton".

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I can determine that we are currently at step 4 of the source test case, which involves confirming the rename action. Let's proceed with the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/addShoppingListButton, (16, 256), click, NULL): Click the save button to confirm the rename action for the shopping list.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 4 in the source test case, where the "OK" button is clicked to confirm the rename action. In the target app, we're using the save button (with id "pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/addShoppingListButton") to achieve the same functionality.

After this action, we should verify that the rename operation was successful, which aligns with step 5 of the source test case. However, we need to wait for the result of this action before proceeding with the assertion step.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(16, 256)
···

This code uses the coordinates (16, 256) to click the save button, which confirms the rename action for the shopping list. Since coordinates are provided and they are precise, we use them directly in the click action, as per the requirements.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided information, I can analyze the current state of the test migration and provide the next step. Let's review the progress:

1. The source test case involves renaming a shopping list item.
2. The executed actions in the target app align with this goal, including long-clicking a list item, selecting the edit option, inputting a new name, and saving the changes.
3. The last executed action was clicking the save button to confirm the rename action.

The next logical step would be to verify that the rename operation was successful. In the source test case, this is done by asserting the new name of the list item. Let's formulate the corresponding action for the target app:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListNameTextView, (58, 106), "new-list"): Verify that the text of the renamed shopping list item is now "new-list".
~~~

This assertion checks if the shopping list item's name has been successfully updated to "new-list". If this assertion passes, it would indicate that the rename functionality is working as expected in the target app, similar to the source app.

After this assertion, all steps of the source test case have been successfully migrated to the target app. Therefore, we can conclude the test migration:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListNameTextView, (58, 106), "new-list"): Verify that the text of the renamed shopping list item is now "new-list".
DONE
~~~
Based on the provided actions, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
assert d(resourceId="pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListNameTextView").get_text() == "new-list"
···

Note: I've only included the code once, as both ASSERT actions are identical and would result in the same code. There's no need to repeat the assertion.
