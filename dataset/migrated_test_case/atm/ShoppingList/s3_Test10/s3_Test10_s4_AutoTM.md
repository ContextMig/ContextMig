#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with clicking a "Skip" button, but the current page's intentions don't show such a button. Instead, we have a shopping list app already open. Let's start by matching the first meaningful action in the source test case, which is creating a new list.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (280, 28), click, NULL):Click to open the options menu to access the "New list" option
~~~

This action opens the options menu, which should contain the "New list" option as mentioned in the intentions. This corresponds to step 2 in the source test case where a new list is created.
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(280, 28)
···

This code uses the coordinates (280, 28) to click on the ImageButton, which will open the options menu to access the "New list" option. Since coordinates are provided and they are precise, this is the optimal choice for the action as per the requirements.

Based on the provided information, it appears we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case was to click a "Skip" button, which doesn't seem to be present in the target app. Therefore, we'll move on to the next step, which is creating a new list. The executed action sequence shows that we've already clicked to open the options menu, so now we need to select the "New list" option. Here's the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (136, 41), click, "New list"):Click to open a dialog for creating a new shopping list
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 in the source test case, where we click on a button to create a new list. In the target app, we need to click on the "New list" option in the menu to achieve the same functionality.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d.click(136, 41)
···

This code uses the coordinates (136, 41) to click on the "New list" TextView, which should open a dialog for creating a new shopping list. As per the requirements, I've used the coordinates since they are provided and precise.

Based on the provided information, we are currently at step 3 of the source test case, which involves inputting a name for the new shopping list. Let's proceed with this step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, org.openintents.shopping:id/edittext, (21, 313), input, "grocery"):Input the text "grocery" into the list name field
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 of the source test case, where we input the name "grocery" for the new shopping list. The target app has a similar input field for entering the list name, so we can directly use it to input the desired text.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(21, 313)
d(resourceId="org.openintents.shopping:id/edittext").set_text("grocery")
···

Based on the provided information, I can determine that we are currently at step 4 of the source test case. The previous steps have been successfully executed in the target application, including opening the options menu, selecting "New list", and inputting the name "grocery" for the new shopping list. The next step in the source test case is to confirm the creation of the new list. Let's proceed with this step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (228, 347), click, NULL):Click on the "OK" button to confirm the creation of the new list named "grocery"
~~~

This action corresponds to step 4 in the source test case, where the user clicks the "Okay" button to confirm the creation of the new list. In the target application, we have a similar "OK" button that serves the same purpose. By clicking this button, we should complete the creation of the new shopping list named "grocery".
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(228, 347)
···

This code uses the coordinate-based click method, which is the preferred approach as per the requirements. The action is to click on the "OK" button at the specified coordinates (228, 347) to confirm the creation of the new list named "grocery".

Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case semantics, it appears that we have successfully completed steps 1 through 4 of the source test case. The next step is to verify that the new shopping list "grocery" has been created successfully. Let's proceed with the assertion step:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (0, 81), matches, "grocery"):Verify that the newly created shopping list "grocery" is displayed and selected in the spinner
~~~

This assertion checks if the newly created "grocery" list is now visible and selected in the shopping list spinner, which corresponds to step 5 in the source test case. If this assertion passes, we can consider the test case migration complete.
Based on the provided action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
assert d(resourceId="android:id/text1", text="grocery").exists()
···

This code verifies that a TextView with the resource ID "android:id/text1" and text "grocery" exists on the screen, which corresponds to checking if the newly created shopping list "grocery" is displayed and selected in the spinner.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated the first four steps of the source test case to the target application. Let's proceed with the next step:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (0, 81), matches, "grocery"):Verify that the newly created shopping list "grocery" is displayed and selected in the spinner
DONE
~~~

Explanation:
1. We have already executed the assertion to verify that the newly created shopping list "grocery" is displayed and selected in the spinner.
2. This assertion corresponds to step 5 in the source test case, which was to verify the creation of the new shopping list.
3. Since we have successfully migrated all steps from the source test case to the target application, we can conclude the test case migration by adding the DONE statement.

The test case migration is now complete, as we have successfully recreated all the steps from the source test case in the target application, including the final assertion to verify the result.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the provided action:

···
assert d(resourceId="android:id/text1", text="grocery").exists()
···

This code verifies that a TextView with the resource ID "android:id/text1" and the text "grocery" exists in the UI, which corresponds to checking if the newly created shopping list "grocery" is displayed and selected in the spinner.
