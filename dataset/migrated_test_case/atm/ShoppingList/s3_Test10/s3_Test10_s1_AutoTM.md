#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to click on the "Skip" button, but there's no such button mentioned in the current page's intentions. Instead, we see that we're already on a page showing a list of shopping lists. Therefore, we can skip the first step of the source test case and move to the second step, which is creating a new list.

The most appropriate action to create a new list based on the current page's intentions is to click on the floating action button. Here's the recommended next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/fab, (238, 558), click, NULL):Click to open the "Add Shopping List" page
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 in the source test case, which is clicking on the floating action button to create a new list. The next step would be to input the list name, but we'll wait for the result of this action before proceeding.
Based on the provided action and requirements, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(238, 558)
···

This code uses the coordinates (238, 558) to perform a click action, which should open the "Add Shopping List" page. The coordinate-based approach is preferred as per the requirements, and it's the most precise way to interact with the specified UI element.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've already clicked on the floating action button to create a new list, which corresponds to step 2 in the source test case.
2. The current page is the "Add Shopping List" page, which contains input fields for the shopping list name and description.

The next logical step would be to input the list name, which corresponds to step 3 in the source test case. Here's the appropriate action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListNameEditText, (16, 96), input, "grocery"):Input the text "grocery" into the shopping list name field
~~~

This action matches step 3 of the source test case, where we input "grocery" into the list name field. The target app has a specific input field for the shopping list name, which we're utilizing here.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code for the given action:

···
d.click(16, 96)
d(resourceId="pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListNameEditText").set_text("grocery")
···

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (16, 96) to focus on the input field, and then uses the resourceId to set the text "grocery" in the shopping list name field.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at step 3 of the source test case, which involves inputting the name "grocery" for the new shopping list. The next step in the source test case is to confirm the creation of the list. Let's proceed with the corresponding action in the target app:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/addShoppingListButton, (116, 188), click, NULL):Click the "SAVE" button to confirm the creation of the new shopping list
~~~

This action corresponds to step 4 in the source test case, where the user clicks the "Okay" button to confirm the creation of the new list. In the target app, we're using the "SAVE" button to achieve the same purpose.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(116, 188)
···

This code uses the coordinates (116, 188) to click on the "SAVE" button, which confirms the creation of the new shopping list. The coordinate-based approach is preferred as per the requirements, and it's the most direct way to interact with the specified UI element.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I will proceed with the next step of the test case migration. Here's my analysis and response:

1. We have successfully completed steps 1-4 of the source test case:
   - Skipped the initial screen (assumed to be done automatically in the target app)
   - Created a new list by clicking the floating action button
   - Input the name "grocery" for the new list
   - Confirmed the creation of the new list

2. The next step in the source test case is to verify that a TextView with the text "grocery" is displayed, confirming the successful creation of the new shopping list.

3. Based on the current page's intent description, we can see that there's a TextView with the text "grocery" that represents the newly created shopping list.

Therefore, I will provide an assertion to verify the existence of this TextView:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListNameTextView, (58, 106), matches, "grocery"):Verify that a TextView with the text "grocery" is displayed, confirming the successful creation of the new shopping list
DONE
~~~

This assertion checks for the presence of a TextView with the ID "pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListNameTextView" and the text "grocery", which aligns with the final step of the source test case.

I've also included "DONE" to indicate that we have successfully migrated all steps of the source test case to the target app.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the given action:

···
assert d(resourceId="pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListNameTextView", text="grocery").exists()
···

This code asserts that a TextView with the resource ID "pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListNameTextView" and the text "grocery" exists on the screen. This verifies that the shopping list named "grocery" has been successfully created and is displayed.
