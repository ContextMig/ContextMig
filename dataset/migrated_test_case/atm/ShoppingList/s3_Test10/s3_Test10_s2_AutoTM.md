#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to click on a "Skip" button, but there's no such button mentioned in the current page's intentions. Instead, we need to focus on creating a new shopping list, which aligns with step 2 of the source test case.

Let's proceed with creating a new shopping list:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/action_add, (208, 24), click, NULL):Click to create a new shopping list
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 in the source test case, where we click on a button to create a new list. In the target app, this action is represented by clicking on a TextView with the id "br.com.activity:id/action_add".
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d.click(208, 24)
```

This code uses the coordinate-based click operation, which is the preferred method as per the requirements. It clicks on the specified coordinates (208, 24) to create a new shopping list.

#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (32, 227), click, "Save?"): Click on the alert title. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the current and next page JSONs are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (32, 227), long_click, "Save?"): Long click on the alert title. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the current and next page JSONs are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (16, 276), click, "New shopping list"): Click to view or edit the name of the new shopping list. The action does not navigate to a new page, but focuses on the EditText field below for input.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (16, 276), long_click, "New shopping list"): Long click on the "New shopping list" text to potentially open additional options or perform a specific action. No new page or dialog appears after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, , (16, 340), click, NULL): Click to focus on the text input field for entering the name of the new shopping list. The page remains the same with an editable text field for input.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, , (16, 340), long_click, NULL): Long click on the empty edit text field to activate text selection or editing options. The action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the Next Page JSON shows the same dialog structure with minor coordinate changes.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (16, 405), click, "Cancel"): Click to cancel creating a new shopping list and return to the main shopping list page. The next page contains a "New list" button with id "br.com.activity:id/action_add" and an "Add a new list" text view with id "br.com.activity:id/nameShoppingList".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (16, 405), long_click, "Cancel"): Long click on the Cancel button to dismiss the "Save?" dialog without saving the new shopping list. Returns to the main Shopping List page with options to add a new list (br.com.activity:id/action_add) and access more options.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (160, 405), click, "OK"): Click the "OK" button to save the new shopping list. The page after clicking this button shows the details of the newly created shopping list, with an "Add item" input field (id: br.com.activity:id/edDescription) and an empty list view (id: br.com.activity:id/lvItemShoppingList) displaying "No item was added".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (160, 405), long_click, "OK"): Long click on the "OK" button to confirm and save the new shopping list. This action navigates to a new page showing an empty shopping list titled "Untitled" with an option to add items.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the step of creating a new shopping list in the target application. This corresponds to step 3 in the source test case, where we need to input the name of the new list. Here's the next action to take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, , (16, 340), input, "grocery"):Input the text "grocery" into the list name field
~~~

This action matches step 3 of the source test case, where we input the name "grocery" for the new shopping list. The EditText field with coordinates (16, 340) is the appropriate element to input the list name in the target application.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(16, 340)
d.send_keys("grocery")
···

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (16, 340) where the EditText field is located, and then inputs the text "grocery" into it. Since no specific widget ID was provided, we use the `send_keys` method to input the text after clicking on the coordinates.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently in the process of creating a new shopping list. Let's analyze the situation and determine the next step:

1. The source test case has progressed through steps 1, 2, and 3.
2. In the target app, we have already clicked to create a new shopping list and input the name "grocery".
3. The current page shows a dialog with "Save?" title, suggesting we're at the confirmation step.

The next logical step would be to confirm the creation of the new shopping list, which corresponds to step 4 in the source test case. Here's the appropriate action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (160, 384), click, NULL):Click to confirm and save the new shopping list named "grocery"
~~~

This action matches the intention of clicking the "OK" button to save the new shopping list, which aligns with the source test case's step of clicking the "Okay" button to confirm the creation of the new list.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(160, 384)
···

This code uses the coordinates (160, 384) to perform the click action, which is the optimal choice as per the requirements. The action will click the button to confirm and save the new shopping list named "grocery".

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully completed steps 2, 3, and 4 of the source test case. The next step in the source test case is to verify the creation of the new shopping list. Let's proceed with this verification:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/action_bar_title, (49, 35), matches, "grocery"):Verify that the action bar title displays "grocery", confirming the successful creation of the new shopping list
~~~

This assertion checks if the action bar title matches the name "grocery" that we just created for the shopping list. This corresponds to step 5 in the source test case, where we verify the successful creation of the new list.

If this assertion passes, we can consider the test case migration complete. However, to be certain, we should wait for the result of this assertion before concluding the test.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
assert d(resourceId="android:id/action_bar_title").get_text() == "grocery"
···

This code verifies that the action bar title displays "grocery", confirming the successful creation of the new shopping list. It uses the resourceId to locate the TextView and checks its text content.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully completed the migration of the source test case up to step 5. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've created a new shopping list named "grocery".
2. We've confirmed the creation of the list.
3. We've verified that the action bar title displays "grocery".

The next logical step would be to add items to this newly created shopping list. However, the source test case doesn't include this step. Since we've completed all the steps in the source test case, we can conclude that the migration is complete.

Here's the response indicating the completion of the test case migration:

~~~
DONE
~~~

This response indicates that we have successfully migrated all steps of the source test case to the target app. The test case for creating a new shopping list has been fully implemented and verified in the target application.
I understand that you want me to convert Actions into UIAutomator2 code using Python, with the device variable name as 'd'. However, you haven't provided any specific Actions to convert. The input you've given is just "DONE", which doesn't contain any actionable information.

If you'd like me to generate UIAutomator2 code, please provide the specific Actions you want to convert. These should be in the format you described earlier, such as:

ACTION (element, id, coordinates, action, value):purpose

Once you provide these Actions, I'll be happy to convert them into the appropriate UIAutomator2 code for you.
