#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to create a new shopping list. Let's proceed with this step using the available intentions on the current page.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/action_add, (208, 24), click, NULL):Click to add a new shopping list
~~~

This action corresponds to step 1 in the source test case, where we click on the "New list" option. In the target app, we have a dedicated button for adding a new list, which we're using here.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(208, 24)
···

This code uses the coordinates (208, 24) to perform a click action, which is the optimal choice as per the requirements. The action will click on the element to add a new shopping list.

This action navigates to a new page with a list view (id: br.com.activity:id/lvItemShoppingList) for adding items and an "Add item" button (id: br.com.activity:id/action_done).

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the step of creating a new shopping list in the target application. The executed action sequence shows that we have clicked on the "add" button to initiate the creation of a new list. This corresponds to step 1 in the source test case. 

The current page's intent description shows that we are now on a dialog asking to save a new shopping list. To proceed with the test case migration, we need to input the list name and confirm the creation. Here's the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, "", (16, 340), input, "list1"):Enter "list1" as the name for the new shopping list
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (160, 405), click, NULL):Click OK to save the new shopping list
~~~

This action combines steps 2 and 3 from the source test case, as the target application seems to handle the list creation in a single dialog. We input the list name "list1" and then click the OK button to save it.
Based on the given actions, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(16, 340)
d(resourceId="").set_text("list1")
d.click(160, 405)
···

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the EditText at coordinates (16, 340)
2. Enters "list1" into the EditText
3. Clicks the OK button at coordinates (160, 405) to save the new shopping list

This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, suggesting it might not have a specific function in the current context.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/nameShoppingList, (), matches, "list1"):Verify that the newly created list "list1" is displayed
~~~

This assertion corresponds to step 4 in the source test case, where we verify that the newly created list "list1" is displayed. We're using the element with id "br.com.activity:id/nameShoppingList" to check for the presence of "list1", which should be the name of the shopping list we just created.
Based on the provided input, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to verify that the newly created list "list1" is displayed:

···
assert d(resourceId="br.com.activity:id/nameShoppingList", text="list1").exists()
···

This code checks if there's a TextView with the resource ID "br.com.activity:id/nameShoppingList" and the text "list1" exists on the screen. If it exists, the assertion passes; otherwise, it fails.

This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, suggesting it might not have a specific function in the current context.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully created a new shopping list named "list1". The next step in the source test case is to add an item to this list. Let's proceed with that:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, br.com.activity:id/edDescription, (5, 77), click, "Add an item"):Click to focus on the text input field for adding a new item to the shopping list
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, br.com.activity:id/edDescription, (5, 77), input, "item1"):Enter "item1" as the name of the new item
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/action_done, (208, 24), click, NULL):Click to add the item to the shopping list
~~~

This sequence of actions corresponds to steps 9 and 10 in the source test case. We're adapting the process to match the target app's interface, where we directly input the item name and use the "action_done" button to add it, instead of using a separate dialog as in the source app.
Based on the provided actions, I'll convert them into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the converted code:

···
d.click(5, 77)
d(resourceId="br.com.activity:id/edDescription").set_text("item1")
d.click(208, 24)
···

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the input field at coordinates (5, 77) to focus on it.
2. Sets the text "item1" in the input field using its resource ID.
3. Clicks on the "done" action button at coordinates (208, 24) to add the item to the shopping list.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Here's my analysis and recommendation:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/descriptionItemShoppingList, (5, 169), matches, "item1"):Verify that the newly added item "item1" is displayed in the shopping list
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've successfully created a new shopping list named "list1", added a new item "item1" to it, and confirmed its addition.
2. The next logical step is to verify that the item "item1" is indeed displayed in the shopping list, which corresponds to step 11 in the source test case.
3. In the current page's intent description, we can see that there's a TextView with id "br.com.activity:id/descriptionItemShoppingList" that displays the item description.
4. Therefore, we can use this element to assert that the newly added item "item1" is displayed correctly.

This assertion aligns with the source test case's step 11, where we verify the presence of the newly added item. The migration adapts to the specific implementation of the target app while maintaining the same functional purpose as the source test case.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the assertion:

···
assert d(resourceId="br.com.activity:id/descriptionItemShoppingList", text="item1").exists()
···

This code checks if an element with the specified resource ID and text "item1" exists in the shopping list. This assertion verifies that the newly added item "item1" is displayed in the shopping list as requested.

Based on the provided information, I can see that we have successfully migrated most of the steps from the source test case to the target application. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next step:

1. We've created a new shopping list named "list1".
2. We've added an item "item1" to the list.
3. We've verified that both the list and the item are displayed correctly.

The next logical step in the source test case would be to test the list filter functionality. However, in the current page's intent description, I don't see any direct mention of a list filter or spinner. Instead, we have options for more actions through the overflow menu.

Given this, I suggest we explore the options menu to see if there's any functionality similar to filtering or sorting the list. Here's the next action I propose:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (264, 24), click, NULL):Click to open more options menu to look for list filtering or sorting options
~~~

This action will open the options menu, allowing us to see if there are any filtering or sorting capabilities similar to what was present in the source application. If we find such an option, we can proceed with testing it in the next step. If not, we may need to consider this step as not applicable in the target application and move on to the next relevant step from the source test case.
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(264, 24)
···

This code will click on the specified coordinates (264, 24) to open the more options menu, allowing the user to look for list filtering or sorting options. Since the coordinates are precise, we use them directly in the `click()` method of the UIAutomator2 device object.

Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case semantics, it appears that we have successfully completed steps 1-4 and 7-11 of the source test case. The next step to migrate would be step 5, which involves clicking on the list filter spinner. However, the current page's intent description doesn't show a direct equivalent to a list filter spinner.

Given the current page's intentions, the closest action that might relate to list filtering or sorting would be the Settings option. Let's explore this option to see if it contains any list filtering or sorting functionality.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (132, 377), click, "Settings"):Click on "Settings" to open the app settings page and look for list filtering or sorting options

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully completed the main steps of creating a new shopping list, adding an item to it, and verifying its presence. The last action navigated to the Settings page, which wasn't explicitly part of the original test case. However, we can use this opportunity to check if there are any relevant settings that correspond to the remaining steps in the source test case.

Let's proceed with the next logical step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (0, 24), click, NULL):Click on "Settings, Navigate up" to return to the main page with the shopping list
~~~

This action will take us back to the main page where we can continue with any remaining steps from the source test case. If there are no more steps to migrate, we can conclude the test case migration.
Based on the given action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(0, 24)

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully completed most of the steps in the source test case. Let's review the progress and determine the next action:

1. We've created a new shopping list named "list1".
2. We've added an item "item1" to the list.
3. We've verified the presence of both the list and the item.
4. We've attempted to find list filtering options by exploring the settings, but it seems the target app might not have this feature or it might be located elsewhere.

Given that we've completed the main objectives of the test case (creating a list, adding an item, and verifying both), and we've made an attempt to find the list filtering option, we can consider the test case migration as complete.

Here's the response to indicate the completion of the test case migration:

~~~
DONE
~~~

This response indicates that we have successfully migrated the core functionality of the source test case to the target application. While we couldn't find an exact match for the list filtering feature (steps 5 and 6 in the source test case), we made a reasonable attempt to locate it. The main objectives of creating a list, adding an item, and verifying both actions have been successfully completed in the target application.
I understand. I'm ready to assist you in converting the test semantic descriptions into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Please provide the Actions you want me to convert, and I'll generate the corresponding UIAutomator2 code based on the requirements and format you've specified. The device variable name will be 'd' as you've indicated.
