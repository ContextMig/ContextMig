Based on the provided Android test case, here's the corresponding function description following the specified format:

```
This test case is testing the deletion of a shopping list item.

The detailed process with serial numbers is as follows:

1. ACTION (RecyclerView, R.id.recyclerView, (), long_click, NULL): Long click on the first item in the shopping list.

2. ACTION (Button, R.id.delete, (), click, NULL): Click on the "Delete" button to initiate the deletion process.

3. ACTION (Button, android.R.id.button1, (), click, NULL): Click on the "Okay" button to confirm the deletion.

4. ASSERT (RecyclerView, R.id.recyclerView, (), element_not_present, "first_item"): Verify that the first item has been removed from the shopping list.
```

Note: The last assertion is implied based on the context of the test case, as it's not explicitly stated in the original code but is a logical expectation after deleting an item.
