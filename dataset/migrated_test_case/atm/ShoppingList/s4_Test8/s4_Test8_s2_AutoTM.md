#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with opening the options menu, but in the target app, we need to locate the equivalent functionality. Let's proceed with the first step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (264, 24), click, NULL): Click to open more options menu. The menu contains options for "Delete all", "Software update", and "Settings".
~~~

This action corresponds to the first step in the source test case, which is to open the options menu. In the target app, this functionality is represented by the "More options" button located at coordinates (264, 24).
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(264, 24)
···

This code uses the coordinate-based click method as specified in the requirements, which is the optimal choice for this action. The code clicks on the ImageButton located at coordinates (264, 24) to open the more options menu.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (116, 72), click, NULL): Click to select "Delete all" option. This action does not navigate to a new page, but may trigger a confirmation dialog or perform the delete all operation.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (116, 72), long_click, NULL): Long press on the shopping list item to open the context menu with options for "Delete all", "Software update", and "Settings".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (132, 83), click, "Delete all"): Click to delete all shopping lists. The page after clicking this control returns to the main shopping list page, which has a "New list" button with id "br.com.activity:id/action_add" and an "Add a new list" text field with id "br.com.activity:id/nameShoppingList".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (132, 83), long_click, "Delete all"): Long click on "Delete all" option to perform a bulk delete action. This action returns to the main Shopping List page without any visible changes, suggesting it might require additional confirmation or have no effect if no items are present to delete.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Here's my analysis and recommendation:

1. We've successfully opened the options menu in the target app, which aligns with step 1 of the source test case.
2. The next step in the source test case is to click on the "Delete list" option.
3. In the target app, we have a similar option called "Delete all" which seems to correspond to the "Delete list" functionality in the source app.

Given this, here's the next action I recommend:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (132, 83), click, "Delete all"): Click to delete all shopping lists. The page after clicking this control returns to the main shopping list page, which has a "New list" button with id "br.com.activity:id/action_add" and an "Add a new list" text field with id "br.com.activity:id/nameShoppingList".
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 in the source test case. We're clicking on the "Delete all" option, which is functionally similar to the "Delete list" option in the source app. The next step would likely involve confirming this action, similar to step 3 in the source test case. However, we'll wait for the result of this action before proceeding further.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the described action:

···
d.click(132, 83)
···

This code uses the coordinates (132, 83) to click on the "Delete all" option. As per the requirements, using coordinates is preferred when they are precise, which is the case here.

ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (9, 24), click, NULL): Click on the app title bar to return to the main shopping list page. The page remains unchanged, showing the "Add a new list" option and action buttons for creating a new list and accessing more options.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (9, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click on the top bar to potentially access additional options or settings. No new page or dialog appears after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/action_bar_title, (49, 35), click, "Shopping List"): Click on the "Shopping List" title. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the Current Page JSON and Next Page JSON are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/action_bar_title, (49, 35), long_click, "Shopping List"): Long click on the action bar title. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes in the UI based on the provided JSON data.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/action_add, (208, 24), click, NULL): Click to add a new shopping list. A dialog appears with a title "Save?", an input field for the new list name, and "Cancel" and "OK" buttons.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/action_add, (208, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click on the "New list" button. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, suggesting it might not have a specific function or the long-click action is not implemented for this button.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (264, 24), click, NULL): Click to open more options menu. The menu contains options for "Delete all", "Software update", and "Settings".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (264, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click on "More options" button to open additional menu options. The action does not navigate to a new page or create new visible elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TableLayout, , (5, 77), click, NULL): Click to add a new shopping list. A dialog appears with a title "Save?", an editable text field, and "Cancel" and "OK" buttons to confirm or cancel the new list creation.
ACTION (android.widget.TableLayout, , (5, 77), long_click, NULL): Long click on the "Add a new list" area to open a dialog for creating a new shopping list. The dialog contains an EditText field for entering the list name, and "Cancel" and "OK" buttons with ids "android:id/button2" and "android:id/button1" respectively.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/nameShoppingList, (13, 82), click, "Add a new list"): Click to open a dialog for creating a new shopping list. The dialog contains an EditText for entering the list name, and buttons for "Cancel" (id: android:id/button2) and "OK" (id: android:id/button1).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/nameShoppingList, (13, 82), long_click, "Add a new list"): Long click to open a dialog for creating a new shopping list. The dialog contains an EditText for entering the list name, and "Cancel" and "OK" buttons with ids "android:id/button2" and "android:id/button1" respectively.

Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Here's my analysis and recommendation:

1. We've successfully completed the first step of the source test case by opening the options menu.
2. The second step in the source test case is to click on the "Delete list" option, but in the target app, we've clicked on "Delete all" instead. This is slightly different but functionally similar, as it's still performing a deletion action.
3. The next step in the source test case is to confirm the deletion by clicking the "OK" button in a confirmation dialog.

Given this analysis, here's the next recommended action:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (132, 83), "Delete all"):Verify that the "Delete all" option was clicked
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (), click, NULL):Click on the "OK" button to confirm the deletion of all lists
~~~

This response includes:
1. An assertion to verify that we indeed clicked on the "Delete all" option.
2. An action to click the "OK" button to confirm the deletion, which aligns with the third step of the source test case.

Note that we're assuming a confirmation dialog appears after clicking "Delete all", similar to the source test case. If this assumption is incorrect and no confirmation dialog appears, please let me know, and I'll adjust the migration strategy accordingly.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given actions:

···
assert d(resourceId="android:id/title", text="Delete all").exists()
d(resourceId="android:id/button1").click()
···

This code first asserts that the "Delete all" option exists and is visible, then clicks the "OK" button to confirm the deletion of all lists. I've used the resourceId for both operations as it's generally more reliable than coordinates, especially when the UI might change slightly across different devices or screen sizes.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided information, it appears that we are in the process of migrating a test case for deleting a shopping list. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next step:

1. We've successfully opened the options menu by clicking the ImageButton.
2. We've clicked on the "Delete all" option, which is similar to but not exactly the same as the "Delete list" option in the source test case.
3. The assertion for the "Delete all" option was successful.
4. The attempt to click the "OK" button failed, which suggests that the confirmation dialog might not have appeared as expected.

Given this situation, we need to adjust our approach. The target app seems to have a "Delete all" option instead of a "Delete list" option, and the confirmation dialog might not appear automatically. Let's try to proceed with the available options:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/nameShoppingList, (13, 82), click, "Add a new list"): Click to open a dialog for creating a new shopping list. The dialog contains an EditText for entering the list name, and buttons for "Cancel" and "OK".
~~~

Explanation:
- Since we couldn't find a direct "Delete list" option and the "Delete all" action didn't lead to the expected confirmation dialog, we'll try to create a new list first. This will ensure we have a list to delete, which might trigger the delete confirmation dialog in subsequent steps.
- After creating a list, we can try to delete it using the available options.
- This approach allows us to continue with the test case migration by ensuring we have the necessary conditions to test the deletion functionality.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(13, 82)
···

This code uses the coordinates (13, 82) to click on the TextView with the text "Add a new list", which will open the dialog for creating a new shopping list.

#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (32, 227), click, "Save?"): Click on the alert title. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the current and next page JSONs are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (32, 227), longClick, "Save?"): Long click on the alert title. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (16, 276), click, "New shopping list"): Click on the message text to view or edit the new shopping list name. No change in page layout, but may trigger focus on the EditText field below for input.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (16, 276), long_click, "New shopping list"): Long click on the message text to potentially copy or edit the text "New shopping list". No new page or dialog appears after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, "", (16, 340), click, NULL): Click to focus on the input field for entering the name of the new shopping list. The page remains the same with an editable text field for input.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, , (16, 340), long_click, NULL): Long click on the empty EditText to activate text selection or input options. The page remains the same with no new elements appearing.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (16, 405), click, "Cancel"): Click to cancel saving the new shopping list. Returns to the main shopping list page with options to add a new list and access more options.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (16, 405), long_click, "Cancel"): Long click the Cancel button to dismiss the "Save?" dialog without saving changes. Returns to the main Shopping List screen with options to add a new list (id: br.com.activity:id/action_add) and view more options.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (160, 405), click, "OK"): Click to save the new shopping list. This navigates to a new page with a title "Untitled" and an input field with id "br.com.activity:id/edDescription" to add items to the list.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (160, 405), long_click, "OK"): Long click on the OK button to save the new shopping list. This action adds a new item "Untitled" to the shopping list view with id "br.com.activity:id/lvShoppingList" on the main page.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are in the process of migrating a test case for deleting a shopping list. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next step:

1. The source test case involves deleting a shopping list through the options menu.
2. In the executed actions, we've already opened the options menu and clicked on "Delete all" instead of "Delete list".
3. The attempt to click the "OK" button to confirm the deletion failed.
4. The last successful action was clicking on "Add a new list".

Given this context, it seems that the target app's structure or flow is different from the source app. We need to adapt our approach. Since we couldn't delete the list as intended, let's try to continue with creating a new list and then attempt to delete it.

Here's the next step I propose:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, "", (16, 340), input, "Test List"):Enter a name for the new shopping list
~~~

This action aims to input a name for the new shopping list we're creating. After this, we'll need to save the list and then attempt to delete it to align with the original test case's goal.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d.click(16, 340)
d.send_keys("Test List")
```

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (16, 340) where the EditText is located, and then inputs the text "Test List" into the field. Since no specific widget ID was provided, we use the `send_keys()` method to input the text after clicking on the coordinates.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information and the executed action sequence, it appears that we are in the process of creating a new shopping list after attempting to delete all lists. Let's continue with the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (), click, NULL): Click on the "OK" button to confirm the creation of the new shopping list named "Test List".
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already opened the options menu and attempted to delete all lists, which aligns with the first step of the source test case.
2. The deletion confirmation step failed, possibly because there were no lists to delete or the confirmation dialog didn't appear as expected.
3. We then proceeded to create a new list, which is not part of the original test case but seems necessary to continue with the deletion test.
4. Now that we've entered a name for the new list ("Test List"), the next logical step is to confirm its creation by clicking the "OK" button.

This action will create a new list that we can then attempt to delete, aligning with the overall goal of the original test case. After this action, we should be able to proceed with the deletion process as outlined in the source test case.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d(resourceId="android:id/button1").click()
```

This code clicks on the "OK" button to confirm the creation of the new shopping list named "Test List". The action uses the resourceId of the button, which is the most reliable method when coordinates are not provided.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information and the executed action sequence, it appears that we are in the process of deleting a shopping list. However, the target application seems to have a different flow compared to the source test case. Let's proceed with the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (264, 24), click, NULL): Click to open options menu to access the delete option
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (132, 83), "Delete all"): Verify that the "Delete all" option is available in the menu
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (132, 83), click, "Delete all"): Click on the "Delete all" option to delete all shopping lists
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already opened the options menu and clicked on "Delete all" in the previous steps.
2. The confirmation dialog with an "OK" button didn't appear as expected, so we're asserting the presence of the "Delete all" option and clicking it again to ensure the deletion process is initiated.
3. We're not including the confirmation step (clicking "OK") at this point since it failed in the previous attempt. We'll wait to see if the deletion occurs without explicit confirmation or if a different confirmation method is required.

This approach aims to complete the deletion process while adapting to the differences in the target application's flow. We'll need to observe the results of these actions to determine if further steps are needed to complete the deletion process.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the provided actions:

···
d.click(264, 24)
assert d(resourceId="android:id/title", text="Delete all").exists()
d(resourceId="android:id/title", text="Delete all").click()
···

This code accomplishes the following:

1. Clicks on the ImageButton at coordinates (264, 24) to open the options menu.
2. Verifies that the "Delete all" option is available in the menu.
3. Clicks on the "Delete all" option to delete all shopping lists.

The code uses coordinates for the first click action and resource ID with text for the assertion and the second click action, as per the requirements and the provided information.

#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (32, 259), click, "Excluir?"): Click on the alert title. Clicking this element does not navigate to a new page or trigger any changes, as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (32, 259), long_click, "Excluir?"): Long click on the alert title. This action does not lead to a new page or create new widgets. The dialog with confirmation message and "Yes"/"No" buttons remains unchanged.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (16, 308), click, "Do you want to delete all the shopping lists?"): Click on the message to read the confirmation prompt. No new page or widgets appear after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (16, 308), long_click, "Do you want to delete all the shopping lists?"): Long click on the confirmation message. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (16, 373), click, "No"): Click to dismiss the deletion confirmation dialog without deleting the shopping lists. The page returns to the main shopping list view with the existing list items still present.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (160, 373), click, "Yes"): Click to confirm deletion of all shopping lists. After clicking, the page returns to the main shopping list view with an empty list and an "Add a new list" option with id "br.com.activity:id/nameShoppingList".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (160, 373), long_click, "Yes"): Long click on the "Yes" button to confirm deletion of all shopping lists. This action navigates to the main Shopping List page, which contains a "New list" button with id "br.com.activity:id/action_add" and an "Add a new list" text field with id "br.com.activity:id/nameShoppingList".

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently at the step of confirming the deletion of all shopping lists. The source test case is about deleting a shopping list, and we've already opened the options menu and selected the delete option. Now, we need to confirm the deletion. Let's proceed with the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (160, 373), click, "Yes"): Click to confirm deletion of all shopping lists.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in the source test case, where we click the "OK" button to confirm the deletion. In this target app, the confirmation button is labeled "Yes" instead of "OK", but it serves the same purpose. By clicking this button, we should complete the deletion process as intended in the original test case.
Based on the provided action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(160, 373)
···

This code uses the coordinates (160, 373) to perform the click action, which is the optimal choice as per the given requirements. The action confirms the deletion of all shopping lists by clicking the "Yes" button.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (9, 24), click, NULL): Click on the app title bar to return to the main shopping list page. The page remains unchanged, showing the "Add a new list" option and action buttons for creating a new list and accessing more options.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (9, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click on the top bar to potentially access additional options or settings. No new page or dialog appears after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/action_bar_title, (49, 35), click, "Shopping List"): Click on the "Shopping List" title. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the Current Page JSON and Next Page JSON are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/action_bar_title, (49, 35), long_click, "Shopping List"): Long click on the action bar title. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes in the UI based on the provided JSON data.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/action_add, (208, 24), click, NULL): Click to add a new shopping list. A dialog appears with a title "Save?", an input field for the new list name, and "Cancel" and "OK" buttons.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/action_add, (208, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click on the "New list" button. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, suggesting it might not have a specific function or the long-click action is not implemented for this button.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (264, 24), click, NULL): Click to open more options menu. The menu contains options for "Delete all", "Software update", and "Settings".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (264, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click on "More options" button to open additional menu options. The action does not navigate to a new page or create new visible elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TableLayout, , (5, 77), click, NULL): Click to add a new shopping list. A dialog appears with a title "Save?", an editable text field, and "Cancel" and "OK" buttons to confirm or cancel the new list creation.
ACTION (android.widget.TableLayout, , (5, 77), long_click, NULL): Long click on the "Add a new list" area to open a dialog for creating a new shopping list. The dialog contains an EditText field for entering the list name, and "Cancel" and "OK" buttons with ids "android:id/button2" and "android:id/button1" respectively.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/nameShoppingList, (13, 82), click, "Add a new list"): Click to open a dialog for creating a new shopping list. The dialog contains an EditText for entering the list name, and buttons for "Cancel" (id: android:id/button2) and "OK" (id: android:id/button1).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/nameShoppingList, (13, 82), long_click, "Add a new list"): Long click to open a dialog for creating a new shopping list. The dialog contains an EditText for entering the list name, and "Cancel" and "OK" buttons with ids "android:id/button2" and "android:id/button1" respectively.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully completed the migration of the source test case to the target application. Let's review the steps:

1. We opened the options menu (matched with the first step of the source test case).
2. We clicked on "Delete all" instead of "Delete list" (this is an adaptation to the target app's functionality).
3. We confirmed the deletion by clicking "Yes" (matched with the third step of the source test case).

All the steps from the source test case have been addressed, albeit with some adaptations to fit the target application's structure. Therefore, we can conclude that the test case migration is complete.

Here's the response in the required format:

Thank you for providing the device variable name and the actions. However, I notice that the "Actions" section is empty, with only "DONE" written. This means there are no specific actions to convert into UIAutomator2 code at this time.

If you have any specific actions or assertions you'd like to convert into UIAutomator2 code, please provide them in the format you described earlier. Once you have actions to convert, I'll be happy to assist you in creating the appropriate UIAutomator2 code in Python.

If you have any questions or if you'd like to provide actions for conversion, please feel free to do so, and I'll be ready to help.
