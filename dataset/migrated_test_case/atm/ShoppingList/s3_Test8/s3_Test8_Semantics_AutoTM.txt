~~~

~~~
```

Note: 
1. The test case doesn't include any explicit assertions, so there are no ASSERT statements in the description.
2. The exact purpose of clicking the third menu item is not clear from the test case, so the description is kept generic.
3. The RETURN action is not applicable in this test case as there's no explicit return to a previous state.
4. The resource IDs are not directly used in the actions as they are part of complex matchers in the original test case.
