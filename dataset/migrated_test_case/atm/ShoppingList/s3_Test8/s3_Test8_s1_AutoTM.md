#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.support.v7.widget.LinearLayoutCompat, , (0, 168), click, NULL):Click on the third item in the navigation menu (Settings)
~~~

Explanation:
1. The source test case's second step is to click on the third item in the navigation menu.
2. In the current page's intent description, we can see that the third item in the navigation drawer is "Settings", which corresponds to the action "ACTION (android.support.v7.widget.LinearLayoutCompat, , (0, 168), click, NULL)".
3. This action will navigate to the Settings page, which aligns with the purpose of clicking the third item in the navigation menu of the source test case.
4. We're using the LinearLayoutCompat element instead of NavigationMenuItemView as it's the available element that represents the menu item in the target app.

This step completes the migration of the source test case. However, we need to wait for the execution result of this action before we can conclude if the migration is complete or if further steps are needed.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the given action:

···
d.click(0, 168)
···

This code uses the coordinates provided (0, 168) to perform a click action on the third item in the navigation menu, which is described as the "Settings" option. Using coordinates is the optimal choice as per the requirements, and it's the most precise way to interact with the specific UI element in this case.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), click, NULL): Click on the "Navigate up" button to return to the main shopping lists page. The next page displays a list of shopping lists with items such as "tomato" and their completion status.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click on the "Navigate up" button to return to the main shopping lists page, which displays a list of shopping lists with their names, completion percentages, item counts, and modification dates.
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/design_menu_item_text, (16, 168), click, "Settings"): Click on Settings to open the settings page. The page displays various settings options including Language, Sharing shopping lists via messages, Name, Description, and Version information.
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/design_menu_item_text, (16, 168), long_click, "Settings"): Long click on the "Settings" menu item. This action does not navigate to a new page or show new widgets, as the current page is already the Settings page.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (0, 80), click, NULL): Click on the "Language" option to open language settings. The page remains the same after this action, indicating that a dialog or submenu for language selection might appear.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (0, 80), longClick, NULL): Long click on the "Language" option to potentially open a menu or dialog for selecting the app language. No new page appears, but a dialog or options menu for language selection may be displayed.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (16, 96), click, "Language"): Click on the Language setting to open a dialog for language selection. The next page shows a dialog with language options including "Default", "English", and "Polski".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (16, 96), long_click, "Language"): Long click on "Language" option opens a language selection dialog with options for Default, English, and Polski languages, and a CANCEL button.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/summary, (16, 118), click, "Default"): Click to open language selection dialog. The next page shows a dialog with language options including "Default", "English", and "Polski", along with a "CANCEL" button.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/summary, (16, 118), long_click, "Default"): Long click on the "Default" language setting to open a language selection dialog. The dialog displays options for "Default", "English", and "Polski" languages, with a "CANCEL" button (id: android:id/button2) at the bottom.
ACTION (android.widget.CheckBox, android:id/checkbox, (272, 210), click, NULL): Click the checkbox to toggle the "Include list name" setting. This action does not navigate to a new page, but changes the state of the checkbox.
ACTION (android.widget.CheckBox, android:id/checkbox, (272, 284), longClick, NULL): Long click on the checkbox to toggle the "Description" setting. This action doesn't navigate to a new page, but may change the state of the checkbox and update the "Include list description" setting.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. The source test case has completed two steps: opening the navigation drawer and clicking on the third item in the menu.
2. The executed action sequence shows that we have successfully opened the navigation drawer and clicked on the "Settings" item.
3. The current page's intent description indicates that we are now on the Settings page.

Given this context, we can conclude that the test case migration has successfully matched the source test case steps. Now, we need to verify that we are indeed on the Settings page and potentially interact with some settings.

Here's the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (16, 96), "Language"):Verify that the Language setting is present on the Settings page
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (16, 96), click, NULL):Click on the Language setting to open language selection dialog
~~~

Explanation:
1. We first assert the presence of the "Language" setting to confirm we're on the correct page.
2. Then, we click on the Language setting to open the language selection dialog, which aligns with the next logical step after navigating to the Settings page.

This step ensures that we've successfully navigated to the Settings page as intended in the source test case, and begins to interact with the settings, which is a natural progression of the test scenario.
Based on the provided actions, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
assert d(resourceId="android:id/title", text="Language").exists()
d.click(16, 96)
···

This code first asserts that the "Language" setting is present on the Settings page by checking for the existence of a TextView with the specified resource ID and text. Then, it clicks on the Language setting using the provided coordinates.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (40, 223), click, "Language"): Click on the Language title. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes, as the dialog with language options remains displayed.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (40, 223), longClick, "Language"): Long click on the Language title. This action does not navigate to a new page or show new widgets. The dialog with language options remains unchanged.
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 259), click, "Default"): Click to select the default language option. The action does not navigate to a new page, but updates the selected language in the current dialog.
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 259), long_click, "Default"): Long click on the "Default" language option. This action does not navigate to a new page, but may trigger a context menu or additional options related to language selection.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (215, 407), click, "CANCEL"): Click to cancel language selection and return to the Settings page. The page after clicking this button is the Settings page, which includes options for Language, Name, Description, and Version.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (215, 407), long_click, "CANCEL"): Long click on the CANCEL button to dismiss the language selection dialog and return to the Settings page without changing the language. The next page shows the original Settings screen with options for Language, Sharing shopping lists, Name, Description, and Version information.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully navigated to the Settings page and opened the Language selection dialog. The next step in the migration process should focus on selecting a language option. Here's the suggested next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 259), click, "Default"):Click to select the default language option
~~~

This action corresponds to the second step in the source test case, where we select an item from the menu. In this case, we're selecting the default language option from the language selection dialog. 

The reasons for this choice are:
1. We've already opened the navigation drawer and navigated to the Settings page, which aligns with the first step of the source test case.
2. The second step in the source test case involves selecting an item from a menu, which is analogous to selecting a language option in this context.
3. Among the available actions on the current page, selecting a language option is the most logical next step after opening the language selection dialog.

This action doesn't complete the entire test case migration, but it progresses us to the next logical step in the process. After this action, we should wait for the result and then decide on further actions, such as confirming the language change or returning to the main settings page.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the described action:

···
d.click(16, 259)
···

This code uses the coordinates (16, 259) to click on the CheckedTextView element with the text "Default" to select the default language option. Using coordinates is the preferred method as specified in the requirements.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (40, 223), click, "Language"): Click on the Language title. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes, as the dialog with language options remains displayed.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (40, 223), longClick, "Language"): Long click on the Language title. This action does not navigate to a new page or show new widgets. The dialog with language options remains unchanged.
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 259), click, "Default"): Click to select the default language option. The action does not navigate to a new page, but updates the selected language in the current dialog.
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 259), long_click, "Default"): Long click on the "Default" language option. This action does not navigate to a new page, but may trigger a context menu or additional options related to language selection.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (215, 407), click, "CANCEL"): Click to cancel language selection and return to the Settings page. The page after clicking this button is the Settings page, which includes options for Language, Name, Description, and Version.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (215, 407), long_click, "CANCEL"): Long click on the CANCEL button to dismiss the language selection dialog and return to the Settings page without changing the language. The next page shows the original Settings screen with options for Language, Sharing shopping lists, Name, Description, and Version information.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully completed the migration of the source test case to the target application. Let's analyze the situation:

1. The source test case involved opening the navigation drawer and selecting the third item in the menu.
2. In the executed action sequence, we can see that these steps have been completed:
   - The navigation drawer was opened
   - The third item (Settings) was selected
   - The Language setting was verified and clicked
   - The default language option was selected

Given that all the steps from the source test case have been executed and additional steps related to language selection have been performed, we can conclude that the test case migration is complete. Therefore, I will respond with DONE.

~~~
DONE
