### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (9, 24), click, NULL): Click to navigate back to the previous screen or home screen. The action does not result in any visible changes to the current page or new elements appearing.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (9, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click on the action bar to potentially open additional options or settings. No new page or dialog appears, as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/action_bar_title, (49, 35), click, "Shopping List"): Click on the action bar title. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the page content remains the same after the interaction.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/action_bar_title, (49, 35), long_click, "Shopping List"): Long click on the "Shopping List" title. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the Current Page JSON and Next Page JSON are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/action_add, (208, 24), click, NULL): Click to create a new shopping list. This opens a dialog with a title "Save?" (id: android:id/alertTitle), an input field for the new list name (type: android.widget.EditText), and two buttons: "Cancel" (id: android:id/button2) and "OK" (id: android:id/button1).

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with a long click on the first item in the shopping list view. Let's find a corresponding action in the target app that matches this functionality.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, br.com.activity:id/lvShoppingList, (5, 77), long_click, NULL): Long click on the shopping list to open a context menu with options to Rename, Duplicate, Delete, Schedule, Share, and Share via text for the selected list item.
~~~

This action corresponds to the first step in the source test case. It performs a long click on the shopping list item, which should open a context menu with various options, including a delete option that we'll need for the next step.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d(resourceId="br.com.activity:id/lvShoppingList").long_click(1)
···

This code performs a long click on the ListView element with the specified resource ID. The long click is performed for 1 second, which is the standard duration for a long click action in UIAutomator2.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (8, 164), click, NULL): Click to select the "Rename" option. The action does not navigate to a new page, but remains on the same options menu with choices for Rename, Duplicate, Delete, Schedule, Share, and Share via text.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (8, 164), long_click, NULL): Long press on the list item opens a context menu with options to Rename, Duplicate, Delete, Schedule, Share, and Share via text.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/tvOptionName, (8, 164), click, "Rename"): Click to open the rename dialog for the shopping list. Clicking this control does not navigate to a new page, as the next page JSON is identical to the current page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/tvOptionName, (8, 164), long_click, "Rename"): Long click on the "Rename" option. The action does not navigate to a new page, but opens a context menu with options including Rename, Duplicate, Delete, Schedule, Share, and Share via text.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the first step of the test case migration. The source test case's first step is to long-click on a shopping list item, which has been successfully executed in the target app. Now, we need to proceed with the next step, which is to delete the shopping list. Let's examine the current page's intentions and choose the appropriate action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/tvOptionName, (8, 164), click, "Delete"): Click on the "Delete" option in the context menu to delete the selected shopping list.
~~~

This action corresponds to the second step in the source test case, where we need to click on the "Delete" option. Although the exact element ID is different, the functional purpose is the same. We're selecting the "Delete" option from the context menu that appeared after the long-click action.
Based on the given action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d(text="Delete").click()
···

This code uses the text attribute to locate and click the "Delete" option, as it's the most reliable method given the information provided. The coordinates are not used in this case because the text attribute is more specific and less prone to changes across different device sizes or screen resolutions.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully completed the first two steps of the source test case. Let's proceed with the final step, which is to verify the empty state message. Here's the next action we should take:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/empty_view, (), matches, "No shopping list was created"): Verify that the empty state message is displayed correctly after deleting the shopping list.
~~~

This assertion aims to check if the empty state message is displayed correctly after deleting the shopping list. I've adjusted the message and the element ID based on the target application's structure, as it might differ from the source application.

If this assertion passes, we can consider the test case migration complete. If it fails, we may need to investigate further or consider alternative ways to verify the empty state.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the assertion:

···
assert d(resourceId="br.com.activity:id/empty_view").get_text() == "No shopping list was created"
···

This code checks if the TextView with the specified resource ID contains the expected text, verifying that the empty state message is displayed correctly after deleting the shopping list.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated the test case for deleting a shopping list and verifying the empty state message. Let's analyze the steps:

1. The source test case involved long-clicking on a shopping list item, clicking the delete option, and verifying an empty state message.

2. In the target app, we have executed the following actions:
   - Long-clicked on the shopping list item
   - Clicked on the "Delete" option in the context menu
   - Verified the empty state message

3. These actions correspond closely to the steps in the source test case, with slight differences in the element IDs and the exact wording of the empty state message.

4. All executed actions were successful (Exec_Success).

Given that we have completed all the steps from the source test case and verified the empty state, it appears that we have successfully migrated the entire test case. Therefore, I believe we can conclude this migration.
