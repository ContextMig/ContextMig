### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), click, "OI Shopping List"): Click on the "OI Shopping List" title. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the page structure remains the same after the interaction.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), long_click, "OI Shopping List"): Long click on the "OI Shopping List" text to potentially open additional options or perform an action related to the shopping list. The long click action does not navigate to a new page or create new visible elements based on the provided Next Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (232, 28), click, NULL): Click to clean up the shopping list. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, but it likely removes checked or completed items from the list displayed in the ListView with id "org.openintents.shopping:id/list_items".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (232, 28), long_click, NULL): Long click on the "Clean up list" button to perform advanced list cleaning operations. No new page or dialog appears, suggesting the action might have been executed directly or the response is not visible in the provided JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (280, 28), click, NULL): Click on the "More options" button to open a menu with various options including New list, Pick items, Theme, Settings, Rename list, Delete list, Send list, Mark all items, Check updates, About, and Privacy.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (280, 28), long_click, NULL): Long click on "More options" button opens a dialog to create a new shopping list. The dialog contains an input field with id "org.openintents.shopping:id/edittext" for entering the list name, and "OK" and "CANCEL" buttons with ids "android:id/button1" and "android:id/button2" respectively.
ACTION (android.widget.Spinner, org.openintents.shopping:id/spinner_listfilter, (0, 80), click, "grocery list"): Click to open the list filter dropdown. A new dropdown menu appears with a selectable item "grocery list" (id: android:id/text1) for choosing the shopping list to display.
ACTION (android.widget.Spinner, org.openintents.shopping:id/spinner_listfilter, (0, 80), long_click, "grocery list"): Long click on the shopping list spinner. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the Current Page JSON and Next Page JSON are identical.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with a long click on the first item in the shopping lists list view. Let's find a corresponding action in the target app that matches this functionality.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, org.openintents.shopping:id/list_items, (0, 104), long_click, NULL): Long press on the shopping list to open a context menu with options for managing list items.
~~~

This action corresponds to the first step in the source test case. We're performing a long click on the shopping list, which should open a context menu with options for managing the list items. This is functionally similar to the source test case's action of long-clicking on a shopping list item to initiate the deletion process.
Based on the given action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform a long click on the specified coordinates:

```
d.long_click(0, 104, 1)
```

This code uses the device variable 'd' as specified, performs a long click at the coordinates (0, 104), and the duration of the long click is set to 1 second.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (TextView, android:id/title, (), click, NULL): Click on the "Delete" option in the context menu.
~~~

Explanation:
1. The source test case's second step is to click on the "Delete" option in the context menu after long-pressing an item.
2. The executed action sequence shows that we've successfully performed a long-click on the shopping list, which should have opened a context menu.
3. Although we don't have an exact match for the "Delete" option in the current page's intentions, it's logical to assume that such an option would be present in the context menu opened by the long-click action.
4. The next step in our migration should be to select the delete option from this context menu.

Note: If this action fails to execute successfully, we may need to explore alternative methods to delete a shopping list, such as using the "More options" menu or looking for a different UI element to perform the deletion.
Based on the provided action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d(resourceId="android:id/title", text="Delete").click()
···

I've used the resourceId and text attributes to identify the "Delete" option in the context menu, as it's more reliable than using coordinates in this case. The click action is performed on this element.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case, it appears we are currently at step 2 of the test case, which is to delete a shopping list item. However, the last action to click on the "Delete" option failed. This could be because the context menu options in the target app are different from the source app. Let's try to find an alternative way to delete the item based on the current page's intentions.

Given that the long-click on the shopping list was successful, we should now have a context menu open. Let's explore the options available in the "More options" menu, as it might contain a delete function.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (280, 28), click, NULL): Click on the "More options" button to open a menu with various options including Delete list.
~~~

This action should open a menu with more options, including a "Delete list" option that we can use to complete the deletion step of our test case.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(280, 28)
···

This code uses the coordinate-based click operation, which is the preferred method as per the requirements. It clicks on the "More options" button located at coordinates (280, 28) to open a menu with various options, including Delete list.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are in the process of migrating a test case for deleting a shopping list. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next step:

1. The source test case involves long-clicking on a list item, then clicking on a "Delete" option.
2. In the target app, we've successfully long-clicked on a list item, but clicking on the "Delete" option failed.
3. We've then opened the "More options" menu, which likely contains the "Delete list" option.

Given this context, the next logical step would be to select the "Delete list" option from the opened menu. Here's the proposed next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (136, 281), click, "Delete list"): Click on the "Delete list" option to open a confirmation dialog for deleting the current shopping list.
~~~

This action aims to select the "Delete list" option from the menu we've just opened. It matches the intention of the original test case (deleting a list) while adapting to the slightly different UI structure of the target app.
Based on the provided action and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d.click(136, 281)
···

This code uses the coordinates (136, 281) to click on the "Delete list" option. As per the requirements, using coordinates is preferred when they are precise, which is the case here.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (40, 290), click, "Do you really want to delete this shopping list?"): Click on the alert title. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets. The alert dialog remains open with the same "CANCEL" and "OK" buttons.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (40, 290), longclick, "Do you really want to delete this shopping list?"): Long click on the alert title. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes, as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (151, 340), click, "CANCEL"): Click the "CANCEL" button to dismiss the delete confirmation dialog and return to the main shopping list page with options to add items, clean up list, and access more options.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (151, 340), longClick, "CANCEL"): Long click on the "CANCEL" button to dismiss the delete confirmation dialog. After this action, the app returns to the main shopping list page, which includes a spinner with id "org.openintents.shopping:id/spinner_listfilter" and an "ADD" button with id "org.openintents.shopping:id/button_add_item".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (228, 340), click, "OK"): Click to confirm deletion of the shopping list. This action navigates to the main shopping list page, which contains a list view with id "org.openintents.shopping:id/list_items" and an add item button with id "org.openintents.shopping:id/button_add_item".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (228, 340), long_click, "OK"): Long click on the "OK" button to confirm deletion of the shopping list. This action leads to the main shopping list page, which includes a list filter spinner with id "org.openintents.shopping:id/spinner_listfilter" and an add item input field with id "org.openintents.shopping:id/autocomplete_add_item".

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently at the step of confirming the deletion of a shopping list. Let's proceed with the next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (228, 340), click, "OK"): Click to confirm deletion of the shopping list.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 in the source test case, where we click on the "Delete" option. In the target app, we've already navigated to the delete confirmation dialog, so clicking "OK" will complete the deletion process.

After this action, we should be able to verify if the shopping list has been deleted and if an empty state message is displayed, which aligns with step 3 of the source test case.
Based on the provided action and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···

#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), click, "OI Shopping List"): Click on the "OI Shopping List" title. This action doesn't navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the page content remains the same after the interaction.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), longClick, "OI Shopping List"): Long click on the "OI Shopping List" title to potentially open additional options or settings for the shopping list. No new page or dialog appears, as the JSON structure remains the same after the action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (232, 28), click, NULL): Click to clean up the shopping list. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, but likely removes completed or unnecessary items from the list displayed in the ListView with id "org.openintents.shopping:id/list_items".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (232, 28), long_click, NULL): Long click on the "Clean up list" button to potentially access additional options or perform a specific action related to cleaning up the shopping list. No new page or dialog appears after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (280, 28), click, NULL): Click to open the options menu. The menu contains items like "New list", "Pick items", "Theme", "Settings", "Rename list", "Delete list", "Send list", "Mark all items", "Check updates", "About", and "Privacy".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (280, 28), long_click, NULL): Long press on 'More options' button to open a dialog for creating a new shopping list. The new dialog contains an input field with id "org.openintents.shopping:id/edittext" for entering the list name, and buttons "CANCEL" and "OK" with ids "android:id/button2" and "android:id/button1" respectively.
ACTION (android.widget.Spinner, org.openintents.shopping:id/spinner_listfilter, (0, 80), click, "My shopping list"): Click to open the shopping list selection dropdown. The next page shows a dropdown menu with a checkable item "My shopping list" with id "android:id/text1".
ACTION (android.widget.Spinner, org.openintents.shopping:id/spinner_listfilter, (0, 80), longclick, "My shopping list"): Long click on the shopping list spinner to potentially open a context menu or perform an action related to list management. No new page or dialog appears after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (0, 81), click, "My shopping list"): Click on the spinner to open the shopping list selection dropdown. The next page shows a CheckedTextView with the same text and ID, indicating the list selection options are now visible.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (0, 81), long_click, "My shopping list"): Long click on the shopping list name to open options. No new page or dialog appears, suggesting the action might trigger a context menu or have no visible effect.
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, org.openintents.shopping:id/list_items, (0, 104), click, NULL): Click on the shopping list area. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the JSON for the current and next pages are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, org.openintents.shopping:id/list_items, (0, 104), long_click, NULL): Long click on the shopping list to open a context menu for item management. The action does not navigate to a new page or create new visible widgets.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated the deletion of a shopping list from the source test case to the target application. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next step:

1. We've completed the deletion of the shopping list, which corresponds to steps 1 and 2 of the source test case.
2. The next step in the source test case is to verify the empty state message.

Given this, we should now proceed to verify the empty state message in the target application. Here's the next action we should take:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, org.openintents.shopping:id/empty, (), matches, "No items. Press Menu to add new list or items."): Verify that the empty state message is displayed correctly after deleting the shopping list.
~~~

This assertion checks for the presence of an empty state message, which is functionally similar to step 3 in the source test case. The exact text of the message may differ between the source and target applications, but the purpose remains the same - to confirm that the list is empty after deletion.

If this assertion passes, we can consider the test case migration complete. If it fails, we may need to explore other options or adjust our approach.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the assertion:

···
assert d(resourceId="org.openintents.shopping:id/empty", className="android.widget.TextView").get_text() == "No items. Press Menu to add new list or items."
···

This code checks if the TextView with the specified resource ID contains the expected text, verifying that the empty state message is displayed correctly after deleting the shopping list.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated the test case for deleting a shopping list. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've completed the long-click on the shopping list item.
2. We attempted to click on the "Delete" option in the context menu, but it failed.
3. We adapted by clicking on the "More options" button and then selecting "Delete list" from the menu.
4. We confirmed the deletion by clicking "OK" on the confirmation dialog.
5. We've verified the empty state message after deleting the list.

These steps correspond to all the actions in the source test case. The migration has been completed successfully, with some adjustments made to accommodate the differences in the target application's UI and functionality.

Given that we've completed all the steps from the source test case and verified the final assertion, we can conclude that the test case migration is complete. Therefore, I will respond with DONE:

~~~
DONE

I understand that you want me to convert Android test semantic descriptions into UIAutomator2 code in Python, using the device variable name 'd'. However, you haven't provided any specific Actions to convert. The input you've given only includes the device variable name and "DONE".

Without any actual Actions to convert, there's no UIAutomator2 code to generate. If you have specific Actions you'd like me to convert, please provide them in the format you described earlier:

ACTION (element, id, coordinates, action, value):purpose

Once you provide these Actions, I'll be happy to convert them into the appropriate UIAutomator2 code for you.
