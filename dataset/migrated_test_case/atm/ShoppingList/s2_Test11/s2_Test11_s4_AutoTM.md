#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. Let's start with the first step of the source test case:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, org.openintents.shopping:id/list_items, (0, 104), click, NULL):Click on the first item in the shopping list
~~~

This action corresponds to the first step in the source test case, which is clicking on the first item in the shopping list. The target app seems to have a similar ListView component with the same purpose, so we can use it for this step.
Based on the given action and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(0, 104)
···

This code uses the coordinates provided (0, 104) to click on the first item in the shopping list. Since precise coordinates are given, we use them directly for the click operation, which is the preferred method according to the requirements.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case, it appears we have successfully completed the first step of the test case migration. Now, let's proceed with the next step.

In the source test case, the next action is to click on the "Add item" action menu item. However, in our target app, we don't see a direct equivalent for this action. Instead, we have an "ADD" button that seems to serve a similar purpose. Let's use this button to add a new item to the list.

Here's the next action I propose:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, org.openintents.shopping:id/button_add_item, (232, 593), click, "ADD"):Click on the ADD button to open the dialog for adding a new item to the shopping list
~~~

This action should open a dialog for adding a new item, which aligns with the purpose of the second step in our source test case. We're adapting to the different UI of the target app while maintaining the same functional goal.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(232, 593)
···

This code uses the coordinates (232, 593) to click on the ADD button, which is the preferred method as per the requirements. The click action will open the dialog for adding a new item to the shopping list.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (12, 278), click, "Pick items"): Click on "Pick items" to open the item selection page. The page remains unchanged after clicking, with the same "Pick items" title and "OK" button.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (12, 278), long_click, "Pick items"): Long click on "Pick items" text. This action does not navigate to a new page or show new widgets, as the current and next page JSONs are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, org.openintents.shopping:id/button1, (12, 331), click, "OK"): Click to confirm item selection and return to the main shopping list page, which contains a list view with id "org.openintents.shopping:id/list_items" and an add item button with id "org.openintents.shopping:id/button_add_item".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, org.openintents.shopping:id/button1, (12, 331), longClick, "OK"): Long click on the OK button to confirm item selection. This action returns to the main shopping list page, which contains a list view with id "org.openintents.shopping:id/list_items" and an add item button with id "org.openintents.shopping:id/button_add_item".

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've successfully clicked on the first item in the shopping list.
2. We've clicked on the ADD button to open the dialog for adding a new item.

The next step in the source test case is to input "Apple" into the description field. However, the current page's intentions don't show an input field. Instead, we see a "Pick items" option. This suggests that the target app might have a different flow for adding items, possibly selecting from a predefined list rather than direct text input.

Given this, let's proceed with the most logical next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (12, 278), click, "Pick items"):Click on "Pick items" to open the item selection page
~~~

This action should open a page where we can select items to add to the shopping list. After this, we'll need to see the new page's intentions to determine how to proceed with selecting "Apple" or the closest available option.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code to perform the specified action:

···
d.click(12, 278)
···

This code uses the coordinates (12, 278) to click on the "Pick items" TextView. Since coordinates are provided and they are precise, we use them directly for the click action as it's the preferred method according to the requirements.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (12, 278), click, "Pick items"): Click on "Pick items" to open the item selection page. The page remains unchanged after clicking, with the same "Pick items" title and "OK" button.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (12, 278), long_click, "Pick items"): Long click on "Pick items" text. This action does not navigate to a new page or show new widgets, as the current and next page JSONs are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, org.openintents.shopping:id/button1, (12, 331), click, "OK"): Click to confirm item selection and return to the main shopping list page, which contains a list view with id "org.openintents.shopping:id/list_items" and an add item button with id "org.openintents.shopping:id/button_add_item".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, org.openintents.shopping:id/button1, (12, 331), longClick, "OK"): Long click on the OK button to confirm item selection. This action returns to the main shopping list page, which contains a list view with id "org.openintents.shopping:id/list_items" and an add item button with id "org.openintents.shopping:id/button_add_item".

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the third step of the source test case, which involves entering an item into the shopping list. However, the target application seems to have a different flow for adding items. Instead of directly entering text, it appears to have a "Pick items" option. Let's proceed with the next logical step in the target application:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, org.openintents.shopping:id/button1, (12, 331), click, "OK"):Click to confirm item selection and return to the main shopping list page
~~~

This action aims to confirm the item selection and return to the main shopping list page. Although it doesn't exactly match the source test case's step of entering "Apple" into a text field, it serves a similar purpose of adding an item to the list. After this action, we should be back on the main shopping list page where we can verify if an item has been added.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code based on the given action:

···
d.click(12, 331)
···

This code uses the coordinates provided (12, 331) to perform a click action, which should confirm the item selection and return to the main shopping list page. Using coordinates is the preferred method as specified in the requirements.

ACTION (android.widget.Button, org.openintents.shopping:id/button_add_item, (232, 593), long_click, "ADD"): Long press on the "ADD" button to trigger the barcode scanner functionality. A dialog appears prompting to download the Barcode OI Plugin, with options to "CANCEL" (id: android:id/button3) or proceed with "WEB DOWNLOAD" (id: android:id/button2).

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've clicked on the first item in the shopping list.
2. We've clicked the ADD button to open a dialog for adding a new item.
3. We've clicked on "Pick items" to open the item selection page.
4. We've confirmed the item selection and returned to the main shopping list page.

The next step in the source test case is to input "Apple" into the description field. However, in the target app, we've gone through a different flow involving picking items instead of directly inputting them. Let's try to find the closest match to continue the test case.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, org.openintents.shopping:id/autocomplete_add_item, (20, 592), click, NULL):Click to focus on the input field for adding a new item to the shopping list
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, org.openintents.shopping:id/autocomplete_add_item, (20, 592), input, "Apple"):Enter "Apple" into the add item input field
ACTION (android.widget.Button, org.openintents.shopping:id/button_add_item, (232, 593), click, "ADD"):Click to add the new item "Apple" to the shopping list
~~~

This sequence attempts to add "Apple" to the shopping list using the available input field and ADD button, which is functionally similar to the source test case step of entering "Apple" into the description field.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the provided actions:

```
d.click(20, 592)
d(resourceId="org.openintents.shopping:id/autocomplete_add_item").set_text("Apple")
d.click(232, 593)
```

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the input field for adding a new item.
2. Enters "Apple" into the add item input field.
3. Clicks the "ADD" button to add the new item "Apple" to the shopping list.

Based on the provided information, I'll analyze the current state of the test migration and determine the next step. Here's my response:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.ListView, org.openintents.shopping:id/list_items, (0, 104), contains, "Apple"):Verify that the added item "Apple" is displayed in the shopping list
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've successfully completed the process of adding "Apple" to the shopping list, which corresponds to steps 1-4 in the source test case.
2. The next logical step is to verify that the item has been added correctly, which aligns with step 5 of the source test case.
3. In the source app, this was done by checking a specific TextView. However, in the target app, we don't have information about a specific TextView for each item. Instead, we know that items are displayed in a ListView.
4. Therefore, we're asserting that the ListView with id "org.openintents.shopping:id/list_items" contains the text "Apple".
5. This assertion serves the same purpose as step 5 in the source test case, verifying that the added item is displayed correctly.

If this assertion passes, we can consider the test case migration complete. If you confirm that this assertion is correct and passes, please let me know, and I can then respond with "DONE" to indicate successful completion of the test migration.
Based on the given input, here's the UIAutomator2 code to assert that the added item "Apple" is displayed in the shopping list:

···
assert "Apple" in d(resourceId="org.openintents.shopping:id/list_items").child(className="android.widget.ListView").get_text()
···

This code checks if the text "Apple" is contained within the text of the ListView element with the specified resource ID. This approach is more reliable than using coordinates, as it directly interacts with the UI element based on its unique identifier.

#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), click, "OI Shopping List"): Click on the "OI Shopping List" title. This action does not navigate to a new page or cause any visible changes in the UI elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), long_click, "OI Shopping List"): Long click on the app title to open additional options. Long clicking does not navigate to a new page, but may trigger a context menu or additional functionality related to the shopping list app.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (232, 28), click, NULL): Click to clean up the list. No new page appears, but the action might have removed checked items or performed some cleanup operation on the current list.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (232, 28), long_click, NULL): Long click on "Clean up list" button to remove checked items from the list. No new page appears, but the checked items in the list with id "org.openintents.shopping:id/list_items" may be removed.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (280, 28), click, NULL): Click to open the options menu. The menu contains items: "New list", "Pick items", "Theme", "Settings", "Rename list", "Delete list", "Send list", and "Mark all items".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (280, 28), long_click, NULL): Long press on "More options" button to open a dialog for creating a new shopping list. The new dialog contains an input field with id "org.openintents.shopping:id/edittext" for entering the list name, and "OK" and "CANCEL" buttons with ids "android:id/button1" and "android:id/button2" respectively.
ACTION (android.widget.Spinner, org.openintents.shopping:id/spinner_listfilter, (0, 80), click, "list"): Click to open the list filter dropdown. The dropdown shows two options: "list" and "My shopping list", both with id "android:id/text1" and type "android.widget.CheckedTextView".
ACTION (android.widget.Spinner, org.openintents.shopping:id/spinner_listfilter, (0, 80), long_click, "list"): Long click on the spinner to potentially open a context menu or trigger a specific action related to list filtering. The action does not navigate to a new page or create new visible widgets.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (0, 81), click, "list"): Click to open the shopping list selection dropdown. The next page shows a list of shopping lists including "list" and "My shopping list" as selectable options.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (0, 81), long_click, "list"): Long click on the list spinner to open the list selection options. No new page appears, but a dropdown menu or dialog with list options might be displayed.
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, org.openintents.shopping:id/list_items, (0, 104), click, NULL): Click on the shopping list to select an item. Clicking this control does not navigate to a new page, but allows interaction with the items in the list, such as checking/unchecking items or accessing item details.
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, org.openintents.shopping:id/list_items, (0, 104), longclick, NULL): Long click on the list item to open a context menu. The menu likely contains options to edit, delete, or perform other actions on the selected item, though these options are not visible in the provided Next Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (0, 104), click, NULL): Click on the list item "Apple" to select or interact with it. No new page is loaded, but the item might be highlighted or selected for further actions.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (0, 104), long_click, NULL): Long click on the list item to open a context menu with options to edit or delete the item. The context menu is not visible in the Next Page JSON, suggesting it might be a separate overlay or dialog not captured in the main layout.
ACTION (android.widget.RelativeLayout, org.openintents.shopping:id/check_surround, (0, 104), click, NULL): Click to toggle the checkbox state of the "Apple" item in the shopping list. The checkbox with id "org.openintents.shopping:id/check" is updated to reflect the new state.
ACTION (android.widget.RelativeLayout, org.openintents.shopping:id/check_surround, (0, 104), long_click, NULL): Long click on the item to open a context menu. The menu likely includes options to edit or delete the item, but these options are not visible in the provided Next Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.CheckBox, org.openintents.shopping:id/check, (20, 105), click, NULL): Click to toggle the checkbox state for the "Apple" item in the shopping list. No new page appears, but the checkbox state changes.
ACTION (android.widget.CheckBox, org.openintents.shopping:id/check, (20, 105), long_click, NULL): Long click on the checkbox to open a context menu for the "Apple" item. The context menu likely includes options to edit or delete the item, though these options are not visible in the provided Next Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.RelativeLayout, org.openintents.shopping:id/description, (62, 104), click, NULL): Click on the item description to open the "Edit item" dialog. The dialog contains editable fields for item details such as name, quantity, units, price, tags, priority, and note, with "CANCEL" and "OK" buttons at the bottom.
ACTION (android.widget.RelativeLayout, org.openintents.shopping:id/description, (62, 104), long_click, "Apple"): Long click on the item description to open a context menu with options to edit, mark, manage stores, remove, copy, delete, or move the item.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, org.openintents.shopping:id/name, (62, 106), click, "Apple"): Click on the item "Apple" to open the edit item dialog. The dialog contains fields for editing item details such as quantity, units, price, tags, priority, and note, with corresponding input fields like "org.openintents.shopping:id/editquantity", "org.openintents.shopping:id/editunits", and "org.openintents.shopping:id/editprice".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, org.openintents.shopping:id/name, (62, 106), long_click, "Apple"): Long click on the item "Apple" to open a context menu with options to edit, mark, manage stores, remove, copy, delete, or move the item.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, org.openintents.shopping:id/autocomplete_add_item, (20, 346), click, "Apple "): Click to focus on the input field for adding new items to the shopping list. The page remains the same after this action, with no new widgets appearing.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, org.openintents.shopping:id/autocomplete_add_item, (20, 346), longClick, "Apple "): Long click on the text input field to open a context menu with options to CUT, COPY, and PASTE text. The menu appears at the bottom of the screen with buttons for these actions.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, org.openintents.shopping:id/button_add_item, (232, 347), click, "ADD"): Click to add the item "Apple" to the shopping list. The item is added to the list_items ListView with id "org.openintents.shopping:id/list_items", and the autocomplete_add_item EditText is cleared.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, org.openintents.shopping:id/button_add_item, (232, 347), long_click, "ADD"): Long click on the ADD button to open a dialog prompting to download Barcode OI Plugin.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I can see that we have successfully migrated most of the steps from the source test case to the target application. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've clicked on the shopping list (equivalent to step 1 in the source test case).
2. We've added an item "Apple" to the list (equivalent to steps 2, 3, and 4 in the source test case).
3. We've verified that "Apple" is in the list (equivalent to step 5 in the source test case).

It appears that we have successfully migrated all steps from the source test case to the target application. The process in the target app required some additional steps (like picking items and confirming), but the core functionality of adding an item to the list and verifying its presence has been achieved.

Given this, I believe we have completed the test case migration. Here's the response:

~~~
DONE
~~~

This response indicates that we have successfully matched all steps of the source test case in the target application, completing the migration process.
I understand that you're looking for UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the given device variable name and actions. However, you haven't provided any specific actions to convert into code. The "DONE" at the end of your message suggests that there are no actions to process.

If you have any specific actions you'd like converted into UIAutomator2 code, please provide them in the format you described earlier:

ACTION (element, id, coordinates, action, value):purpose

or

ASSERT (element, id, coordinates, oracle):purpose

Once you provide these actions, I'll be happy to convert them into the appropriate UIAutomator2 code for you.
