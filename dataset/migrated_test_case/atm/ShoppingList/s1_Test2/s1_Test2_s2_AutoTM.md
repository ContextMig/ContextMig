#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to click on the first shopping list in the list view. Looking at the current page's intentions, we can see that clicking on the "family" shopping list item will open its details. This matches our first step in the source test case. Here's the appropriate action to take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/nameShoppingList, (45, 82), click, "family"):Click on the "family" shopping list to open its details
~~~

This action corresponds to step 1 in the source test case, where we click on the first shopping list in the list view. After this action, we should be able to see the details of the "family" shopping list, which will allow us to proceed with the next steps of adding items and sorting the list.
Based on the provided action, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(45, 82)
···

This code uses the coordinates (45, 82) to perform a click action, which is the optimal choice as per the requirements. The action will open the details of the "family" shopping list.

Based on the provided information, it appears we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case has been executed successfully, which corresponds to clicking on a shopping list. Now, let's proceed with the next step in the migration process.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/action_done, (208, 24), click, NULL):Click to add a new item to the shopping list
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 in the source test case, where we click on a floating action button to add a new item. In the target app, we're using the "Add item" button (represented by the action_done TextView) to achieve the same functionality.
Based on the provided input, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(208, 24)
···

This code uses the coordinates (208, 24) to click on the specified location, which corresponds to the action of clicking to add a new item to the shopping list. Since coordinates are provided and they are precise, I've used them as the preferred method for this action.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at step 3 of the source test case, which involves entering an item name into the edit text field. Let's proceed with this step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, br.com.activity:id/edDescription, (5, 77), input, "water"):Enter "water" into the item name edit text field
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 of the source test case, where we input "water" into the item name edit text field. The element ID and coordinates have been adjusted to match the target application's layout as described in the current page's intent description.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code to perform the specified action:

···
d(resourceId="br.com.activity:id/edDescription").set_text("water")
···

This code uses the resource ID of the EditText field to set the text "water" directly. This approach is preferred when we have a unique and non-empty ID for the widget, as it's more reliable than using coordinates for text input operations.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've clicked on the "family" shopping list.
2. We've clicked on the action to add a new item.
3. We've entered "water" into the item name edit text field.

The next logical step in the source test case is to save the newly added item. In the target app, this action seems to be represented by clicking the "Add item" button. Here's the next action I recommend:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/action_done, (208, 24), click, NULL):Click to add the item "water" to the shopping list
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/descriptionItemShoppingList, (), matches, "water"):Verify that the newly added item "water" is displayed in the list
~~~

This action corresponds to step 4 in the source test case (clicking the "Save" button), and I've included an assertion to verify that the item has been added successfully, which corresponds to step 5 in the source test case.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given actions:

···
d.click(208, 24)
assert d(resourceId="br.com.activity:id/descriptionItemShoppingList", text="water").exists()
···

This code does the following:
1. Clicks on the specified coordinates (208, 24) to add the item "water" to the shopping list.
2. Verifies that the newly added item "water" is displayed in the list by checking for its existence using the resourceId and text attributes.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've successfully added the "water" item to the shopping list.
2. The next step in the source test case is to open the options menu and sort the list.
3. In the target app, we have an "More options" button that can open a menu with various actions.

Given this, here's the next action to take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (264, 24), click, NULL):Click on More options button to open a menu with various actions including Search, Check all, Delete checked, Delete all, Barcode scan, Share, and Settings
~~~

This action corresponds to step 6 in the source test case: "Open the options menu". By clicking on the More options button, we're attempting to access the sorting functionality, which should be available in the menu that opens.
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(264, 24)
···

This code uses the coordinates (264, 24) to click on the More options button, which should open a menu with various actions as described. The use of coordinates is preferred as per the requirements, and it's the most precise way to interact with the specified UI element in this case.

The dialog contains a title "Excluir?" (id: android:id/alertTitle), a message (id: android:id/message), and two buttons: "No" (id: android:id/button2) and "Yes" (id: android:id/button1).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (132, 202), long_click, "Delete all"): Long click on "Delete all" option to open a confirmation dialog for deleting all items in the shopping list. The dialog contains a title "Excluir?" (ID: android:id/alertTitle), a message (ID: android:id/message), and two buttons: "No" (ID: android:id/button2) and "Yes" (ID: android:id/button1).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (132, 55), longClick, "Search"): Long click on the "Search" option in the menu. The action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, suggesting it may trigger a contextual action or have no visible effect.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (132, 349), click, "Settings"): Click on "Settings" to navigate to the app settings page. The new page displays various settings options including "Show checkboxes", "Show quantities", "Show prices", and other configuration options for the shopping list app.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (132, 349), long_click, "Settings"): Long-click on "Settings" option to open the Settings page.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've successfully added the "water" item to the shopping list.
2. We've verified that "water" is displayed in the list.
3. We've clicked on the More options button to open the menu.

The next step in the source test case is to sort the list. However, in the current page's intent description, we don't see a direct "Sort" option. Instead, we have options like "Search", "Check all", "Delete checked", "Delete all", "Barcode scan", "Share", and "Settings".

Given this situation, we should look for a way to sort the list, which might be found in the Settings. Here's the next action I propose:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (132, 349), click, "Settings"):Click on "Settings" to navigate to the app settings page where we might find sorting options
~~~

This action will take us to the Settings page, where we can look for sorting options in the next step. If we don't find sorting options there, we'll need to explore other alternatives or consider skipping the sorting step if it's not available in this app.
Based on the provided action and device variable name, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(132, 349)
···

This code uses the coordinates (132, 349) to click on the "Settings" option, as specified in the action description. Using coordinates is the optimal choice as per the requirements, and it's the most precise way to interact with the UI element in this case.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully added the "water" item to the shopping list and opened the options menu. The next step in the source test case is to sort the list. However, the current target app doesn't seem to have a direct "Sort" option in the menu. Let's try to find an alternative way to achieve this functionality.

Given the current state, I suggest we explore the "Settings" option, as it might contain sorting preferences. Here's the next action I recommend:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (132, 377), click, "Settings"):Click on "Settings" to open the app settings page where we might find sorting options
~~~

This action aims to navigate to the Settings page, where we might find options to change the sorting order of the shopping list items.
Based on the provided input, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d.click(132, 377)
···

This code uses the coordinate-based click operation, which is the preferred method as per the requirements. It directly clicks on the "Settings" option at the specified coordinates (132, 377).

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we are currently in the Settings page of the application. The next step in the source test case is to sort the shopping list. However, we need to navigate back to the shopping list page to perform this action. Let's proceed with the following step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (0, 24), click, NULL):Click on "Settings, Navigate up" to return to the main shopping list page
NOT FOUND
~~~

This action will take us back to the shopping list page where we can proceed with the sorting operation.
Based on the provided action and the device variable name, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(0, 24)
···

This code will perform a click action at the coordinates (0, 24), which corresponds to the "Settings, Navigate up" button to return to the main shopping list page.
