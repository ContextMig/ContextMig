#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with a long click on the first item in the shopping list. Let's find the closest matching action in the target application.

~~~
ACTION (android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView, privacyfriendlyshoppinglist.secuso.org.privacyfriendlyshoppinglist:id/recyclerView, (0, 80), long_click, NULL): Long click on the RecyclerView to potentially select multiple shopping lists or activate a multi-selection mode.
~~~

This action corresponds to the first step in the source test case, which is a long click on the first item in the shopping list. The RecyclerView in the target app likely contains the list of shopping lists, so performing a long click on it should activate a selection or context menu, similar to the source app's behavior.
Based on the provided action and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code to perform a long click on the RecyclerView:

···
d(resourceId="privacyfriendlyshoppinglist.secuso.org.privacyfriendlyshoppinglist:id/recyclerView").long_click(1)
···

This code uses the resourceId to identify the RecyclerView and performs a long click operation on it. The `1` parameter in the `long_click()` function specifies the duration of the long click in seconds.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, privacyfriendlyshoppinglist.secuso.org.privacyfriendlyshoppinglist:id/duplicate, (56, 257), click, "DUPLICATE"): Click to duplicate the selected shopping list.
~~~

Explanation:
1. The source test case's first step was to long-click on the first item in the shopping list, which has been successfully executed in the target app (as indicated by the Executed Action Sequence).
2. The second step in the source test case was to click on the second option in the context menu that appears after the long click, which we can infer was likely a "Duplicate" option.
3. In the target app, based on the Current Page's Intent Description, we have a "DUPLICATE" button available after performing a long-click on a list item.
4. Therefore, clicking this "DUPLICATE" button corresponds to the second step of the source test case.

This action should create a duplicate of the selected shopping list, which aligns with the goal of the original test case. After this action, we should be able to verify if the duplication was successful.
Based on the provided action and requirements, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(56, 257)
···

This code uses the coordinate-based click operation, which is the preferred method as per the requirements. The action is performed on the specified coordinates (56, 257) to duplicate the selected shopping list.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll help you with the next step of the test code migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. The source test case is about duplicating a shopping list item.
2. In the target app, we've already performed a long click on the RecyclerView (which likely contains the shopping list items) and then clicked a "DUPLICATE" button.

These actions correspond to steps 1 and 2 of the source test case. Now, we need to verify that the duplication was successful. In the source test case, this was done by checking the names of the first two items in the list. Let's try to do something similar in the target app.

Here's the next step for the test migration:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, privacyfriendlyshoppinglist.secuso.org.privacyfriendlyshoppinglist:id/textview_list_name, (58, 88), matches, "New Shopping List"): Verify that the name of the first item in the shopping list is "New Shopping List".
~~~

This assertion checks if the first item in the list has the name "New Shopping List". We're using the ID and coordinates from the current page's intent description for the list item name.

Note that we're using "New Shopping List" instead of "new-list" because that's the text we see in the current page's intent description. The exact name might be different in the target app, but the principle of checking for a duplicated item remains the same.

If this assertion passes, we should then check for the second item to ensure it has the same name, completing the duplication verification. However, we'll wait for the result of this first assertion before proceeding to the next step.
Based on the provided input, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the assertion:

···
assert d(resourceId="privacyfriendlyshoppinglist.secuso.org.privacyfriendlyshoppinglist:id/textview_list_name").get_text() == "New Shopping List"
···

This code checks if the text of the TextView with the specified resource ID matches "New Shopping List". I've used the resource ID method as it's more reliable than coordinates for text assertions, especially when dealing with different screen sizes or resolutions.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information and the executed action sequence, it appears that we have successfully completed the migration of the test case for duplicating a shopping list item. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We performed a long click on the RecyclerView, which likely selected a shopping list item.
2. We then clicked the "DUPLICATE" button to duplicate the selected shopping list.
3. We verified that the name of the first item in the shopping list is "New Shopping List".

These actions correspond to the steps in the source test case, with some adaptations for the target application. The main difference is that in the target app, we used a RecyclerView long click instead of a ListView long click, and we directly clicked a "DUPLICATE" button instead of selecting an option from a context menu.

To complete the test case migration, we need to verify that there are now two shopping lists with the same name. Let's do that:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, privacyfriendlyshoppinglist.secuso.org.privacyfriendlyshoppinglist:id/textview_list_name, (58, 168), matches, "New Shopping List"): Verify that the name of the second item in the shopping list is also "New Shopping List".
DONE
~~~

This assertion checks if the second item in the shopping list (assuming it's positioned below the first one) also has the name "New Shopping List". If this assertion passes, it confirms that the shopping list was successfully duplicated, matching the behavior of the source test case.

The "DONE" statement indicates that we have successfully migrated all steps of the source test case to the target application.
Based on the provided action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
assert d(resourceId="privacyfriendlyshoppinglist.secuso.org.privacyfriendlyshoppinglist:id/textview_list_name", className="android.widget.TextView").get_text() == "New Shopping List"
···

This code verifies that the text of the specified TextView element matches "New Shopping List". The assertion uses the resourceId and className to locate the element, which is more reliable than using coordinates in this case.
