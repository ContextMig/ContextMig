Based on the provided Android test case, here's the corresponding function description following the specified format:

```
This test case is testing the functionality of duplicating a shopping list item.

The detailed process with serial numbers is as follows:

1. ACTION (ListView, R.id.lvShoppingList, (0), long_click, NULL): Long click on the first item in the shopping list.

2. ACTION (LinearLayout, android.R.id.content, (1), click, NULL): Click on the second option in the context menu that appears after the long click.

3. ASSERT (TextView, R.id.nameShoppingList, (0), matches, "new-list"): Verify that the name of the first item in the shopping list is "new-list".

4. ASSERT (TextView, R.id.nameShoppingList, (1), matches, "new-list"): Verify that the name of the second item in the shopping list is also "new-list".
```

This test case appears to be checking the functionality of duplicating a shopping list item. It performs a long click on the first item, selects an option (presumably to duplicate), and then verifies that both the original and the new item have the same name "new-list".
