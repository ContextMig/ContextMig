````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the step of creating a new shopping list in the target application. This corresponds to steps 1 and 2 in the source test case. Let's proceed with the next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, org.openintents.shopping:id/edittext, (21, 313), input, "list1"):Enter "list1" as the name for the first shopping list
~~~

This action aligns with step 2 of the source test case, where we input the name "list1" for the new shopping list. The target app provides an EditText field specifically for this purpose, so we can directly input the name here.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(21, 313)
d(resourceId="org.openintents.shopping:id/edittext").set_text("list1")
···

This code first clicks on the EditText at the specified coordinates (21, 313), and then uses the resourceId to set the text "list1" in the input field.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I can determine that we are currently at step 3 of the source test case. We have successfully created a new shopping list and entered "list1" as its name. The next step in the migration process should be to confirm the creation of this list. Here's the next action to take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (228, 245), click, NULL):Click to confirm and create a new shopping list named "list1"
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in the source test case: "ACTION (Button, R.id.addShoppingListButton, (), click, NULL): Click the Save button to create the first shopping list." 

In the target app, we're using the "OK" button to confirm the creation of the list, which serves the same purpose as the "Save" button in the source app. This action will create the "list1" shopping list and should return us to the main shopping list view.
Based on the provided action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(228, 245)
···

This code uses the coordinates (228, 245) to perform a click action, which confirms and creates a new shopping list named "list1". Using coordinates is the preferred method as specified in the requirements, and it's the most precise way to interact with the UI element in this case.

Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (280, 28), click, NULL):Click on the options menu to access the "New list" function
ASSERT (android.widget.Spinner, org.openintents.shopping:id/spinner_listfilter, (0, 80), matches, "list1"):Verify that the newly created list "list1" is now visible in the spinner
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (280, 28), click, NULL):Click on the options menu again to create another shopping list
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've successfully created the first shopping list named "list1", which corresponds to steps 1-3 in the source test case.
2. The assertion is added to verify that the newly created list is visible in the spinner, ensuring the creation was successful.
3. The next action is to create another shopping list, which aligns with step 4 in the source test case.

This response focuses on gradually matching the operations in the source test case, proceeding step-by-step as requested. The next step will be to enter the name for the second shopping list.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, I'll convert them into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the implementation:

···
# Click on the options menu to access the "New list" function
d.click(280, 28)

# Verify that the newly created list "list1" is now visible in the spinner
assert d(resourceId="org.openintents.shopping:id/spinner_listfilter").get_text() == "list1"

# Click on the options menu again to create another shopping list
d.click(280, 28)
···

This code follows the requirements:
1. It uses the device variable name 'd' as specified.
2. It prioritizes using coordinates for clicking actions.
3. For the assertion, it uses the resourceId as provided, since coordinates are not suitable for text verification.
4. The code is wrapped in ··· as requested.
5. Each action is implemented uniquely without repetition.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully created the first shopping list named "list1". The next step in the source test case is to create a second shopping list named "list2". Let's proceed with that:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (136, 37), click, "New list"):Click to open a dialog for creating a new shopping list
~~~

This action corresponds to step 4 and 5 in the source test case, where we click on the floating action button to create another shopping list and enter the name "list2". In the target app, we're using the options menu to access the "New list" function instead of a floating action button.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(136, 37)
···

This code uses the coordinates provided (136, 37) to perform a click action on the "New list" TextView element. Since coordinates are available and precise, they are preferred over using the resource ID or text attribute for this action.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets

Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently in the process of creating the second shopping list named "list2". The next logical step would be to confirm and create this new list. Here's the suggested action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (228, 245), click, NULL):Click to confirm and create a new shopping list named "list2"
~~~

This action corresponds to step 6 in the source test case: "Click the Save button to create the second shopping list." The button ID and coordinates are based on the previous similar action for creating "list1".

After this action, we should be ready to proceed with selecting the first shopping list and adding items to it, as per the source test case.
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(228, 245)
···

This code uses the coordinate-based click operation, which is the preferred method according to the requirements. The action clicks on the button at coordinates (228, 245) to confirm and create a new shopping list named "list2".
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (80, 139), click, "Enter name of new shopping list"): Click to focus on the dialog title. No navigation occurs as the same dialog remains open with an EditText field (id: org.openintents.shopping:id/edittext) for entering the new shopping list name, and CANCEL and OK buttons (ids: android:id/button2 and android:id/button1 respectively) for confirming or cancelling the action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (80, 139), long_click, "Enter name of new shopping list"): Long click on the alert title. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new elements, as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.Spinner, org.openintents.shopping:id/spinner_listfilter, (0, 80), matches, "list2"):Verify that the newly created list "list2" is now visible in the spinner
ACTION (android.widget.Spinner, org.openintents.shopping:id/spinner_listfilter, (0, 80), click, NULL):Click on the spinner to open the list of shopping lists
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've successfully created two shopping lists ("list1" and "list2") in the target app, which corresponds to steps 1-6 in the source test case.
2. The next step in the source test case (step 7) is to click on the first shopping list in the list view.
3. In the target app, it appears that the shopping lists are managed through a spinner instead of a list view.
4. Therefore, we first assert that the newly created "list2" is visible in the spinner.
5. Then, we click on the spinner to open the list of shopping lists, which will allow us to select a specific list in the next step.

This approach maintains the functional similarity of selecting a specific shopping list, even though the UI elements and exact actions differ between the source and target apps.
Based on the provided actions, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
assert d(resourceId="org.openintents.shopping:id/spinner_listfilter").get_text() == "list2"
d.click(0, 80)
···

This code first asserts that the text of the spinner with the given resource ID matches "list2", verifying that the newly created list is visible. Then, it clicks on the spinner at the specified coordinates (0, 80) to open the list of shopping lists.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I will continue with the next step of the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next action:

1. We have successfully created two shopping lists: "list1" and "list2".
2. The last executed action was clicking on the spinner to open the list of shopping lists.
3. The next step in the source test case is to select the first shopping list.

Given this, here's the next action to take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (0, 81), click, "list1"):Select the first shopping list "list1" from the dropdown
~~~

This action corresponds to step 7 in the source test case: "Click on the first shopping list in the list view." We're using the spinner in the target app to achieve the same functionality of selecting a specific shopping list.
Based on the provided action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(0, 81)
···

This code uses the coordinates (0, 81) to click on the specified TextView element, which selects the first shopping list "list1" from the dropdown. Since coordinates are provided and are precise, they are used as the preferred method for interaction.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (0, 80), click, "list1"): Click to select the shopping list "list1". The page remains the same with the list of available shopping lists, indicating that the selection was made but no navigation occurred.
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (0, 80), long_click, "list1"): Long click on the "list1" item to potentially open a context menu or perform an action specific to long-pressing a list item. The page remains the same after the long click, suggesting that this action might trigger a popup menu or dialog that is not captured in the JSON data.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I can determine that we are currently at step 8 of the source test case. We have successfully created two shopping lists ("list1" and "list2") and selected "list1". The next step in the source test case is to add a new item to the selected shopping list. Here's the next action to take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (280, 28), click, NULL):Click on the options menu to access the "Add item" function
~~~

This action is chosen because:

1. In the source test case, step 8 involves clicking a floating action button to add a new item. In the target app, we don't see a floating action button in the current page's intentions.

2. Based on the previous actions in the target app, we've been using the options menu (represented by the ImageButton) to access key functions like creating new lists.

3. It's logical to assume that the "Add item" function would also be accessible through this options menu, similar to how we accessed the "New list" function.

4. This action maintains the functional similarity with the source test case (adding a new item to the list) while adapting to the different UI structure of the target app.

After this action is executed, we expect to see options for adding a new item to the selected shopping list "list1". The next steps would involve entering the item details, which we'll handle in subsequent actions based on the new page's intentions that will be provided.
Based on the provided action and requirements, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(280, 28)
···

This code uses the coordinate-based click method as specified in the requirements, clicking on the options menu at the given coordinates (280, 28) to access the "Add item" function.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully created two shopping lists named "list1" and "list2", and we have selected "list1". The next step in the source test case is to add an item to the selected shopping list. Let's proceed with this step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, org.openintents.shopping:id/autocomplete_add_item, (20, 346), click, NULL):Click to focus on the input field for adding a new item to the shopping list
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, org.openintents.shopping:id/autocomplete_add_item, (20, 346), input, "chicken"):Enter "chicken" as the name of the new item
ACTION (android.widget.Button, org.openintents.shopping:id/button_add_item, (232, 347), click, "ADD"):Click to add the new item "chicken" to the shopping list
~~~

This response corresponds to steps 8, 9, and 11 in the source test case. Note that we've combined these steps and adapted them to the target app's UI structure. We've skipped step 10 (selecting the "lb" unit) as there doesn't appear to be a corresponding action in the target app's current page intentions. If unit selection is important, we may need to look for this option in a different menu or dialog after adding the item.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given sequence:

```
d.click(20, 346)
d(resourceId="org.openintents.shopping:id/autocomplete_add_item").set_text("chicken")
d.click(232, 347)
```

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the input field at coordinates (20, 346) to focus on it.
2. Enters "chicken" into the input field using its resource ID.
3. Clicks on the "ADD" button at coordinates (232, 347) to add the new item to the shopping list.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully created two shopping lists ("list1" and "list2") and added an item ("chicken") to "list1". The next step in the source test case is to move the item from one list to another. Let's proceed with this step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, org.openintents.shopping:id/list_items, (0, 104), long_click, NULL):Long-click on the "chicken" item to open the context menu
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (), click, "Move to another list"):Click on the "Move to another list" option in the context menu
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (), click, "list2"):Select "list2" as the destination list for moving the item
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, org.openintents.shopping:id/empty_listview_textview, (), matches, "You have no items on the list. Add one using the button below."):Verify that the original list "list1" is now empty
~~~

This sequence of actions attempts to move the "chicken" item from "list1" to "list2" and then verify that "list1" is empty. Note that the exact coordinates and some IDs might differ in the target app, so I've used placeholder values where necessary. The app should handle these actions appropriately based on its specific implementation.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the described operations:

```
d.long_click(0, 104, 1)
d(text="Move to another list").click()
d(text="list2").click()
assert d(resourceId="org.openintents.shopping:id/empty_listview_textview").get_text() == "You have no items on the list. Add one using the button below."
```

This code performs the following actions:
1. Long-clicks on the "chicken" item at coordinates (0, 104).
2. Clicks on the "Move to another list" option in the context menu.
3. Selects "list2" as the destination list.
4. Verifies that the original list "list1" is now empty by checking the text of the empty list view.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully migrated most of the steps from the source test case. However, we encountered an issue when trying to move the item "chicken" to another list. Let's continue from this point and try an alternative approach to complete the test case migration.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.RelativeLayout, org.openintents.shopping:id/description, (62, 104), long_click, "chicken"):Long click on the item "chicken" to open a context menu with options to edit, mark, manage stores, remove, copy, delete, or move the item
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (), click, NULL):Click on the "Move" option in the context menu to move the item to another list
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (), click, "list2"):Select "list2" as the destination list for moving the item
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, org.openintents.shopping:id/empty_listview_textview, (), matches, "You have no items on the list. Add one using the button below."):Verify that the original list "list1" is now empty
DONE
~~~

Explanation:
1. We use a long click on the item description to open the context menu, as this action is available in the current page's intent description.
2. We then attempt to click on the "Move" option in the context menu. Since we don't have the exact id or coordinates, we use a generic click action.
3. We select "list2" as the destination list for moving the item.
4. Finally, we assert that the original list "list1" is now empty, which matches the last step in the source test case.

This approach should complete the migration of the test case. If successful, all steps from the source test case will have been migrated to the target app. If this approach also fails, we may need to explore other options or consider that the functionality might not be available in the target app in the same way as in the source app.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the provided actions:

···
d.long_click(62, 104, 1)
d(text="Move").click()
d(text="list2").click()
assert d(resourceId="org.openintents.shopping:id/empty_listview_textview").get_text() == "You have no items on the list. Add one using the button below."
···

This code performs the following actions:
1. Long clicks on the "chicken" item at coordinates (62, 104).
2. Clicks on the "Move" option in the context menu.
3. Selects "list2" as the destination list.
4. Verifies that the original list is now empty by checking the text of the empty list view.
