> This test case is testing the functionality of sending a shopping list.
> 
> The detailed process with serial numbers is as follows:
> 
> 1. ACTION (OptionsMenu, , (), click, NULL): Open the action bar overflow or options menu.
> 2. ASSERT (TextView, android.R.id.title, (), isDisplayed): Verify that the "Send list" option is displayed in the menu.
> 3. ACTION (TextView, android.R.id.title, (), click, NULL): Click on the "Send list" option in the menu.
> ```

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with opening the options menu, but the current page's intentions don't directly match this action. Let's try to find the closest match to proceed with the migration.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (72, 38), long_click, "Shopping List"):Long-click on the "Shopping List" title to potentially open options for managing or editing the shopping list, which might include a "Send list" option.
~~~

This action is chosen because:
1. It's the closest match to opening an options menu, which is the first step in the source test case.
2. Long-clicking on the title might reveal additional options, potentially including a "Send list" feature.
3. If this doesn't reveal the required options, we can explore other actions in subsequent steps.
Based on the provided action and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.long_click(72, 38, 1)
···

This code performs a long click operation at the coordinates (72, 38), which corresponds to the "Shopping List" title. The '1' at the end of the long_click() method represents the duration of the long press in seconds.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with opening the options menu, but the executed action in the target app was a long-click on the "Shopping List" title. This action didn't result in opening an options menu with a "Send list" option as expected. 

Let's try to find an alternative way to access the options menu or the "Send list" functionality:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), click, NULL):Click to open the navigation drawer, which might contain the "Send list" option or lead to a menu with this option.
~~~

This action attempts to open the navigation drawer, which might contain the "Send list" option or lead to a menu where we can find this functionality. If this action is successful, we'll need to look for the "Send list" option in the next step.
Based on the provided action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to click the ImageButton at the specified coordinates:

···
d.click(0, 24)
···

This code will click on the ImageButton located at coordinates (0, 24), which should open the navigation drawer as described in the action.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information and the executed action sequence, it appears that we are still in the process of finding the "Send list" option. The source test case is looking for an options menu or overflow menu, which we haven't encountered yet. Let's continue exploring the available options on the current page to find a way to access the "Send list" feature.

Given that we've opened the navigation drawer, let's check if there's any option related to sending or sharing the list. If not, we'll need to close the drawer and look for other ways to access the options menu.

~~~
ACTION (android.support.v7.widget.LinearLayoutCompat, , (0, 168), click, NULL):Click on the "Main" menu item to return to the main view, as the "Send list" option might be accessible from there.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have not yet found the "Send list" option. Let's continue our search by exploring other available options on the current page. Given the function description of the source test case, we need to find a way to access the options menu or action bar overflow menu.

Let's try to locate an element that might represent the options menu or a "More options" button:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, privacyfriendlyshoppinglist.secuso.org.privacyfriendlyshoppinglist:id/imageview_sort, (224, 28), click, NULL): Click on the sort button to check if it opens a menu that might contain the "Send list" option.
~~~

This action attempts to click on the sort button, which might open a menu containing additional options, including the "Send list" option we're looking for. If this action doesn't lead us to the desired option, we'll need to explore other elements on the page in subsequent steps.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(224, 28)
···

This code uses the coordinate-based click method, which is the preferred approach as per the requirements. The action clicks on the sort button located at coordinates (224, 28).

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information and the executed action sequence, it appears that we are still in the process of locating the "Send list" option. The last executed action opened a sort dialog, which doesn't directly correspond to the source test case steps. Let's try to find a more relevant action to match the source test case.

Given that we haven't found the options menu or the "Send list" option yet, we should look for other ways to access these options. Since we're currently in a sort dialog, let's first close this dialog and then look for other menu options.

Here's the next suggested action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (143, 434), click, "CANCEL"):Click the "CANCEL" button to dismiss the sort options dialog and return to the main shopping list screen to look for the options menu or "Send list" feature.
~~~

This action will close the sort dialog and bring us back to the main screen, where we can continue searching for the options menu or the "Send list" feature. After this action, we'll need to reassess the available options on the main screen to find a way to access the options menu or the "Send list" feature.
Based on the given action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(143, 434)
···

This code uses the coordinates (143, 434) to click on the "CANCEL" button. Using coordinates is the preferred method as per the requirements, and it's the most precise way to interact with the specific UI element in this case.

Based on the executed actions and the source test case, it appears that we have not yet found the specific "Send list" option. The next logical step would be to look for an options menu or overflow menu, which is typically represented by three vertical dots in the action bar. Let's try to locate and interact with this menu:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (320, 24), click, NULL):Click on the overflow menu button (usually three vertical dots) in the top-right corner to open the options menu, which may contain the "Send list" option.

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have opened the options menu by clicking on the overflow menu button. This aligns with the first step of the source test case. Let's proceed with the next step, which is to verify if the "Send list" option is displayed in the menu.

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (), isDisplayed):Verify that the "Send list" option is displayed in the menu.
~~~

This assertion checks if there's a TextView with the id "android:id/title" that is displayed, which should correspond to the "Send list" option in the menu. If this assertion passes, we can proceed to the next step of clicking on the "Send list" option. If it fails, we might need to explore other ways to access the "Send list" feature or consider that it might not be available in the target app in the same way as in the source app.
Based on the given input, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to verify that the "Send list" option is displayed in the menu:

···
assert d(resourceId="android:id/title", text="Send list").exists()
···

This code checks if there's a TextView element with the resource ID "android:id/title" and the text "Send list" exists on the screen. The `exists()` method returns True if the element is found and displayed, which satisfies the assertion requirement.

If this action is successful, we can then respond with DONE to indicate that the entire test case has been successfully migrated.
Based on the given input, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d(resourceId="android:id/title", text="Send list").click()
···

This code clicks on the "Send list" option in the menu to initiate the sending of the shopping list. I've used the resourceId and text attributes to locate the element, as they provide a more reliable way to find the specific menu item compared to coordinates in this case.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current state, it appears that we have successfully located and clicked on the overflow menu, which is similar to the OptionsMenu in the source test case. We also verified that the "Send list" option was displayed. However, the final action to click on the "Send list" option failed. 

Let's try an alternative approach to complete this test case:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (), long_click, NULL):Long-click on the "Send list" option in the menu to see if it triggers the send action or reveals additional options.
~~~

This action attempts to long-click the "Send list" option instead of a regular click, as sometimes long-click actions can trigger different behaviors or reveal additional options in mobile applications.
Based on the provided action and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d(resourceId="android:id/title", text="Send list").long_click(1)
···

This code does the following:
1. It uses the device variable name 'd' as specified.
2. It locates the element using both the resourceId and text attributes to ensure precision.
3. It performs a long click operation on the "Send list" option, with a duration of 1 second as required in the common operations.

This approach is preferred because it uses the unique ID and text of the element, which is more reliable than using coordinates when they are not provided. The long_click method is used with the specified duration to ensure the action is performed correctly.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current state, it appears that we have successfully located the options menu, but the "Send list" option is not present or not functioning as expected. Let's try to explore other potential ways to achieve the goal of sending the shopping list. Here's the next step I suggest:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (), click, "Share"):Click on the "Share" option in the menu, which might be an alternative way to send the shopping list.
~~~

This action assumes that there might be a "Share" option in the menu instead of a "Send list" option. Many apps use "Share" functionality to send or export data, including lists. If this action is successful, it should open a sharing dialog or initiate the process of sending the shopping list.

If this action fails or if there's no "Share" option, we might need to explore other alternatives or conclude that the direct "Send list" functionality is not available in this app version. Please execute this action and provide feedback on the result.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d(resourceId="android:id/title", text="Share").click()
···

This code clicks on the "Share" option in the menu. I've used the resourceId and text attributes to identify the element, as they provide a more reliable way to locate the specific "Share" option compared to using coordinates in this case. This approach ensures that the correct "Share" option is clicked, even if its position on the screen might vary across different devices or screen sizes.

Based on the executed action sequence and the current state, it appears that we have successfully located the options menu, but the "Send list" option is not directly available.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (), click, "Share"):Click on the "Share" option in the menu to initiate sharing the shopping list, which is functionally similar to sending the list.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current state, it appears that the test case migration has encountered some difficulties. The "Send list" option or a direct equivalent is not available in the target application's menu. However, we can try to find a functionally similar option to achieve the goal of sharing or sending the shopping list. Let's attempt a different approach:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.FrameLayout, privacyfriendlyshoppinglist.secuso.org.privacyfriendlyshoppinglist:id/cardview_item, (8, 88), long_click, NULL):Long click on a shopping list item to open the context menu, which might contain options for sharing or sending the list.
~~~

This action attempts to open a context menu for a specific shopping list item, which might provide options for sharing or sending the list. If this action is successful, we'll need to look for a share or send option in the resulting menu in the next step.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d(resourceId="privacyfriendlyshoppinglist.secuso.org.privacyfriendlyshoppinglist:id/cardview_item").long_click(1)
```

This code performs a long click on the specified shopping list item using its resource ID. The long click duration is set to 1 second, as required in the common operations guidelines.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, privacyfriendlyshoppinglist.secuso.org.privacyfriendlyshoppinglist:id/title, (24, 102), long_click, "List: list2"): Long click on the list title to open the options menu. The options menu includes buttons for edit, duplicate, share, reset, and delete actions for the selected list.

ACTION (android.widget.Button, privacyfriendlyshoppinglist.secuso.org.privacyfriendlyshoppinglist:id/share, (56, 337), longClick, "SHARE"): Long click on the SHARE button to open sharing options. No new page appears, but a system share dialog or menu is likely to be displayed, allowing the user to choose how to share the list.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, privacyfriendlyshoppinglist.secuso.org.privacyfriendlyshoppinglist:id/reset, (56, 417), click, "RESET"): Click to reset the shopping list "list2". After clicking, the page returns to the main shopping list view, showing the reset list with potentially modified item quantities.

This action opens a confirmation dialog with options to "CANCEL" (id: android:id/button2) or "OKAY" (id: android:id/button1) the deletion.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have reached a point where we can access options for a specific shopping list item. Let's proceed with the next step to match the functionality of sending a shopping list.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, privacyfriendlyshoppinglist.secuso.org.privacyfriendlyshoppinglist:id/share, (56, 337), click, "SHARE"):Click on the SHARE button to initiate sharing the shopping list, which is functionally equivalent to sending the list.
DONE
~~~

This action attempts to use the SHARE button that appears in the context menu after long-clicking a shopping list item. This is likely the closest match to the "Send list" functionality in the source test case. If this action is successful, we can consider the test case migration complete. If not, we may need to explore other options or adjust our approach.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(56, 337)
···

This code uses the coordinates (56, 337) to click on the SHARE button, which is the preferred method as per the requirements. The click action will initiate the sharing of the shopping list.
