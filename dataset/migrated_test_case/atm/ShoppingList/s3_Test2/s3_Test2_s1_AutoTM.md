#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with clicking on the first item in a RecyclerView, which corresponds to selecting a shopping list. In the target app, we have a ListView containing shopping lists. Let's proceed with the first step of the migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shopping_lists_list_view, (16, 96), click, NULL): Click on the first item in the shopping list view to select a shopping list.
~~~

This action corresponds to the first step in the source test case, where we click on the first item in the RecyclerView. In the target app, we're using a ListView instead, but the functionality is similar - selecting a shopping list to view or edit its contents.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d.click(16, 96)
```

This code uses the coordinates (16, 96) to click on the first item in the shopping list view, as specified in the action description. The coordinate-based approach is preferred according to the requirements, and it's the most precise way to interact with the specific element in this case.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully executed the first step of the source test case by clicking on the first item in the shopping list view. Now, let's proceed with the next step of the migration process.

The next step in the source test case is to click on a floating action button to add a new product. In the target application, we have a similar action available. Here's the next step for the migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/fab, (238, 558), click, NULL): Click on the floating action button to add a new shopping list item.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 in the source test case. Although the exact purpose might differ slightly (adding a new product vs. adding a new shopping list), the action of clicking a floating action button to add something new is functionally similar. This should navigate us to a page where we can input details for the new item, which we'll handle in the next step of the migration process.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the described action:

···
d.click(238, 558)
···

This code uses the coordinates (238, 558) to click on the floating action button to add a new shopping list item. The coordinate-based approach is preferred as per the instructions, and it's the most direct way to interact with the specified UI element in this case.

ACTION (android.widget.Button, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/addShoppingListButton, (116, 188), longClick, "SAVE"): Long click on the SAVE button to trigger any potential alternative or additional actions related to saving the shopping list. The long click action does not navigate to a new page or create new elements, as the page content remains the same after the action.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the step of adding a new product to the shopping list. The source test case has already clicked on the first item in the RecyclerView and clicked on the floating action button to add a new product. The executed action sequence shows that we have successfully clicked on a shopping list item and the floating action button in the target app.

The next step in the source test case is to enter "milk" into the product name input field. However, the current page's intent description doesn't show an input field specifically for product name. Instead, we have fields for "Shopping list name" and "Description". Given that we're trying to add a product to an existing list (not create a new list), we should use the "Shopping list name" field to enter our product.

Here's the next action to take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListNameEditText, (16, 96), input, "milk"): Enter "milk" into the Shopping list name input field to add a new product.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in the source test case, where we input the product name. We're using the "Shopping list name" field in the target app to achieve the same functionality of adding a new item to the list.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(16, 96)
d(resourceId="pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListNameEditText").set_text("milk")
···

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (16, 96) to focus on the input field, and then uses the resource ID to set the text "milk" in the Shopping list name input field.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've clicked on the first item in the shopping list view.
2. We've clicked the floating action button to add a new shopping list.
3. We've entered "milk" into the Shopping list name input field.
4. We've clicked the "SAVE" button to confirm adding the new shopping list.

These actions correspond to steps 1-4 of the source test case. The next step in the source test case is to verify that the product name "milk" is displayed in the product list.

Given the current page's intent description, we can see that a new shopping list named "milk" has been added to the ListView. We should now verify its presence. Here's the next action:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListNameTextView, (58, 106), matches, "milk"): Verify that the shopping list name "milk" is displayed in the shopping lists view.
~~~

This assertion checks if the newly added shopping list "milk" is visible in the list view, which corresponds to the verification step in the source test case.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
assert "milk" in d(resourceId="pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListNameTextView").get_text()
```

This code checks if the text "milk" is present in the shopping list name TextView. It uses the resourceId to locate the element and then verifies its text content.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated the first four steps of the source test case to the target application. Let's proceed with the next step of the migration:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListNameTextView, (58, 106), matches, "milk"): Verify that the shopping list name "milk" is displayed in the shopping lists view.
DONE
~~~

Explanation:
1. We have already executed the assertion to verify that the shopping list name "milk" is displayed in the shopping lists view.
2. This assertion corresponds to the final step in the source test case, which was to verify that the product name "milk" is displayed in the product list.
3. Although the exact widget and its ID are different in the target app, the functional purpose (verifying the presence of the newly added item) is the same.
4. Since we have successfully migrated all steps from the source test case to the target application, we can conclude the migration process.

Therefore, I'm responding with DONE to indicate that we have successfully completed the test case migration.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
assert d(resourceId="pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListNameTextView").get_text().lower() == "milk"
···

This code verifies that the shopping list name "milk" is displayed in the shopping lists view. It uses the resourceId to locate the TextView and checks if its text matches "milk" (case-insensitive).
