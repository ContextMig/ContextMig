#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to click on the first shopping list in the main view. Let's match this action with the available intentions on the current page.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/nameShoppingList, (45, 82), click, "family"):Click to open the "family" shopping list
~~~

This action corresponds to the first step in the source test case, which is clicking on a shopping list. The "family" shopping list appears to be the first (and only) list visible on the current page, so this action should open the shopping list view, allowing us to proceed with the next steps of the test case.
Based on the provided action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(45, 82)
···

This code uses the coordinate-based click operation as requested, which is the optimal choice according to the given instructions. The click action is performed at the coordinates (45, 82), which should open the "family" shopping list.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to click on the first shopping list, which has already been executed in the target app by clicking on the "family" shopping list. Now, let's proceed with the next step in the migration process.

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/action_bar_title, (49, 35), textEquals("family")):Verify that the opened shopping list is named "family"
ACTION (android.widget.CheckBox, br.com.activity:id/checkedItemShoppingList, (5, 169), click, NULL):Click on the checkbox of the first item in the shopping list
~~~

Explanation:
1. First, we add an assertion to verify that we have indeed opened the correct shopping list named "family".
2. Then, we proceed to the next step in the source test case, which is to click on the checkbox of the first item. In the target app, we have a matching action for this, so we use it directly.

This response aligns with the second step of the source test case while adapting to the specific elements and IDs available in the target app.
Based on the provided actions, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
assert d(resourceId="android:id/action_bar_title").get_text() == "family"
d.click(5, 169)
···

This code first asserts that the action bar title contains the text "family", verifying that the opened shopping list is named "family". Then, it clicks on the checkbox of the first item in the shopping list using the provided coordinates.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case, we can see that we have successfully opened the "family" shopping list and clicked on the checkbox of the first item. This corresponds to steps 1 and 2 of the source test case. The next logical step would be to verify that the checkbox is checked, which aligns with step 3 of the source test case. Here's the next action to take:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.CheckBox, br.com.activity:id/checkedItemShoppingList, (5, 169), isChecked):Verify that the checkbox of the first item is checked
~~~

This assertion checks if the checkbox we just clicked is indeed checked, which matches the intention of step 3 in the source test case. If this assertion passes, we can move on to the next step in the migration process.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code to verify that the checkbox of the first item is checked:

···
assert d(resourceId="br.com.activity:id/checkedItemShoppingList").info['checked'] == True
···

This code uses the resourceId to locate the checkbox and checks its 'checked' state. If the checkbox is indeed checked, the assertion will pass.

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully completed steps 1-3 of the source test case. We are now at the point where we need to delete the checked items. Let's proceed with the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (264, 24), click, NULL):Click to open options menu to access the "Delete checked" option
~~~

This action corresponds to step 4 in the source test case, where we open the overflow menu. In the target app, we're using the "More options" button to access additional options, including the "Delete checked" functionality.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(264, 24)
···

This code uses the coordinates (264, 24) to perform a click action on the ImageButton that opens the options menu. This approach aligns with the preference for using precise coordinates when available.

Based on the provided information, it appears we are currently at step 5 of the source test case, which involves deleting checked items. Let's proceed with the next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (132, 181), click, "Delete checked"):Click on "Delete checked" option to delete the checked items
~~~

This action corresponds to step 5 in the source test case, where we click on the "Delete checked items" option. In the target app, we have a specific menu item for this purpose, so we can directly click on it.
Based on the provided action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(132, 181)
···

This code uses the coordinates (132, 181) to perform the click action, which is the optimal choice as per the requirements. The action will click on the "Delete checked" option to delete the checked items.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (32, 250), click, "Excluir?"): Click on the alert title. No navigation occurs as the same confirmation dialog remains open with "Yes" and "No" buttons (android:id/button1 and android:id/button2).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (32, 250), long_click, "Excluir?"): Long click on the alert title. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (16, 299), click, "Do you want to delete all the checked items of this shopping lists?"): Click to view the confirmation message. No new page or widgets appear after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (16, 299), long_click, "Do you want to delete all the checked items of this shopping lists?"): Long click on the confirmation message. No new page or dialog appears, as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (16, 383), click, "No"): Click the "No" button to cancel the deletion of checked items in the shopping list. After clicking, the dialog is dismissed and the user returns to the main shopping list view with items "water" and "cheese" still present.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (16, 383), long_click, "No"): Long-click on the "No" button to dismiss the deletion confirmation dialog. After this action, the page returns to the shopping list view with items "water" and "cheese" still present, and an "Add an item" input field at the top.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (160, 383), click, "Yes"): Click to confirm deletion of checked items in the shopping list. This action returns to the main shopping list view, which includes an "Add item" button with id "br.com.activity:id/action_done" and an editable item list with id "br.com.activity:id/lvItemShoppingList".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (160, 383), long_click, "Yes"): Long click on "Yes" button to confirm deletion of checked items in the shopping list. After this action, the page displays an empty shopping list view with an "Add an item" input field (id: br.com.activity:id/edDescription) and a message "No item was added" (id: br.com.activity:id/header_description_collumn).

Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've opened a shopping list named "family".
2. We've checked the first item in the list.
3. We've opened the options menu and clicked on "Delete checked".

The next step in the source test case is to verify that unchecked items remain in the list after deletion. However, in the target app, we're currently presented with a confirmation dialog asking if we want to delete the checked items.

Given this, the appropriate next action would be to confirm the deletion:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (160, 383), click, "Yes"):Click to confirm deletion of checked items in the shopping list
~~~

This action corresponds to step 5 in the source test case (clicking "Delete checked items"), but with an additional confirmation step in the target app. After this action, we should be able to verify if unchecked items remain in the list.
Based on the provided action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d(resourceId="android:id/button1").click()
···

This code uses the resource ID to locate and click the "Yes" button, confirming the deletion of checked items in the shopping list. Using the resource ID is preferred in this case as it's unique and provided in the action description.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/action_done, (208, 24), click, NULL): Click to add an item to the shopping list. The page remains the same after clicking, with no new elements added.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/action_done, (208, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click on the "Add item" button. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the current and next page JSONs are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (264, 24), click, NULL): Click to open the options menu. The menu contains items such as "Search", "Check all", "Delete checked", "Delete all", "Barcode scan", "Share", and "Settings".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (264, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click on the "More options" button to open additional menu options. The action does not lead to a new page, but may display a popup menu with additional actions.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, br.com.activity:id/edDescription, (5, 77), click, NULL): Click to focus on the "Add an item" input field. This action prepares the field for text entry but does not navigate to a new page or show new widgets.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, br.com.activity:id/edDescription, (5, 77), long_click, "Add an item"): Long press on the "Add an item" input field. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes in the UI.
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, br.com.activity:id/lvItemShoppingList, (5, 117), click, NULL): Click on the shopping list to potentially add or view items. No change in page or new widgets appear after this action.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided information, it appears that the test case migration has progressed through several steps, but encountered a failure at the last executed action. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next appropriate step.

The last executed action that failed was:
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (160, 383), click, "Yes"):Click to confirm deletion of checked items in the shopping list, Exec_Fail

This failure suggests that the confirmation dialog for deleting checked items might not be present or might have a different structure in the target application. Let's try an alternative approach to delete the checked items without relying on a confirmation dialog.

Given the current page's intentions, we can see that there's an option to delete checked items directly from the options menu. Let's try using that instead:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (264, 24), click, NULL):Click to open the options menu again to access the "Delete checked" option
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (132, 181), textEquals("Delete checked")):Verify that the "Delete checked" option is present in the menu
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (132, 181), click, "Delete checked"):Click on "Delete checked" option to delete the checked items without confirmation
~~~

This approach attempts to delete the checked items directly from the options menu without going through a confirmation dialog. If this action succeeds, we can then proceed to verify that the unchecked items remain in the list, which corresponds to the last step in the source test case.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(264, 24)
assert d(resourceId="android:id/title", text="Delete checked").exists()
d(resourceId="android:id/title", text="Delete checked").click()
···

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the coordinates (264, 24) to open the options menu.
2. Asserts that the "Delete checked" option exists in the menu.
3. Clicks on the "Delete checked" option to delete the checked items without confirmation.

The code uses coordinates for the first click action as specified in the requirements. For the assertion and the second click action, it uses a combination of resourceId and text attributes, which is more reliable than using coordinates for text elements that might change position.

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully migrated most of the steps from the source test case. Let's proceed with the next step to verify that unchecked items remain in the list after deletion.

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/tvDescription, (45, 169), isDisplayed && isEnabled):Verify that the first item's description is still displayed and enabled after deleting checked items
DONE
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already performed the actions of opening a shopping list, checking an item, verifying it's checked, and deleting checked items.
2. The last step in the source test case is to verify that unchecked items remain in the list after deletion.
3. In the target app, we use the TextView with id "br.com.activity:id/tvDescription" to represent the item's description, which is analogous to the "itemNameTextView" in the source app.
4. We assert that this TextView is displayed and enabled, which matches the intent of the source test case.
5. After this assertion, we have completed all the steps from the source test case, so we can mark the migration as DONE.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the given action:

···
assert d(resourceId="br.com.activity:id/tvDescription").exists and d(resourceId="br.com.activity:id/tvDescription").info['enabled']
···

This code verifies that the TextView with the specified resource ID exists (is displayed) and is enabled. The assertion will pass if both conditions are true, which aligns with the requirement to check if the first item's description is still displayed and enabled after deleting checked items.
