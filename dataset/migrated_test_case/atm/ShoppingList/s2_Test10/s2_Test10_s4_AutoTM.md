#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to create a new shopping list. Let's find the most appropriate action in the target app to achieve this.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (280, 28), click, NULL):Click to open the options menu which contains "New list" option
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (), click, "New list"):Click on the "New list" option to create a new shopping list
~~~

This sequence of actions should open the dialog for creating a new list, which aligns with the first step of the source test case. The next step would be to input the list name, but we'll wait for confirmation of these actions before proceeding.
Based on the provided actions, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(280, 28)
d(text="New list").click()
···

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the ImageButton at coordinates (280, 28) to open the options menu.
2. Clicks on the TextView with the text "New list" to create a new shopping list.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (80, 262), click, "Enter name of new shopping list"): Click on the alert title. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes, as the current and next page JSONs are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (80, 262), long_click, "Enter name of new shopping list"): Long click on the title of the dialog. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the dialog remains unchanged after the long click.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, org.openintents.shopping:id/edittext, (21, 313), click, "e.g. wishlist, family list"): Click to focus on the input field for entering the name of a new shopping list. The page remains the same with the input field ready for text entry.
