#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to create a new shopping list. Let's start with that action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/fab, (238, 558), click, NULL): Click to open the "Add Shopping List" page to create a new list.
~~~

This action corresponds to the first step in the source test case, which is clicking on the "New list" action menu item. In the target app, we're using the floating action button (FAB) to achieve the same purpose of creating a new shopping list.
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(238, 558)
···

This code clicks on the specified coordinates (238, 558) to open the "Add Shopping List" page for creating a new list. Since precise coordinates are provided, we use them directly for the click action.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. The source test case is about creating a new shopping list, and we've already clicked on a button to open the "Add Shopping List" page. Now, we need to input the list name.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListNameEditText, (16, 96), input, "list"): Enter the text "list" into the "Shopping list name" input field.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 in the source test case, where we input the name of the new shopping list. The target app has a specific input field for the shopping list name, which we're using here. The next step would be to save the new list, but we'll wait for confirmation of this action's execution before proceeding.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(16, 96)
d(resourceId="pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListNameEditText").set_text("list")
···

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (16, 96) to focus on the input field, and then uses the resourceId to set the text "list" in the "Shopping list name" input field.

The next page displays a list of shopping lists with a ListView (id: pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shopping_lists_list_view) containing multiple items, each representing a shopping list with details like name, completion percentage, and item count.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we can proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've successfully clicked on the floating action button to open the "Add Shopping List" page.
2. We've entered "list" into the shopping list name input field.

The next logical step in our source test case is to confirm the creation of the new list. In the target app, we have a "SAVE" button that seems to serve this purpose. Here's the next action we should take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/addShoppingListButton, (116, 188), click, NULL): Click the "SAVE" button to confirm the creation of the new shopping list.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in our source test case, where we click the "OK" button to confirm the creation of the new list. After this action, we should be able to verify if the new list has been created successfully.
Based on the provided action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(116, 188)
···

This code uses the coordinates (116, 188) to click the "SAVE" button, which is the most precise method as per the requirements. The action is performed using the device variable 'd' as specified in the device variable name.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I can determine that we have successfully completed the first three steps of the source test case. Let's proceed with the next step, which is to verify that the new list has been created with the correct name.

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListNameTextView, (58, 106), matches, "list"): Verify that a TextView with the text "list" is displayed, confirming the new list has been created with the correct name.
DONE
~~~

This assertion checks if the newly created shopping list with the name "list" is visible on the current page. The element used for this assertion is the TextView with the id "pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListNameTextView", which displays the shopping list name.

I've included the DONE statement because we have successfully migrated all steps of the source test case to the target app. The test case creation, input, confirmation, and verification have all been completed.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the provided action:

···
assert "list" in d(resourceId="pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListNameTextView").get_text()
···

This code verifies that the TextView with the specified resource ID contains the text "list", confirming that the new list has been created with the correct name. The `matches` condition is implemented using the `in` operator to check if "list" is a part of the TextView's text.
