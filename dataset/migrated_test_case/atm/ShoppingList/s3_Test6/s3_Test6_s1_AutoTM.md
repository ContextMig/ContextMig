> 
> ```
> This test case is testing the deletion of an item from a shopping list.
> 
> The detailed process with serial numbers is as follows:
> 
> 1. ACTION (RecyclerView, R.id.recyclerView, (), click, NULL): Click on the first item in the shopping list.
> 
> 2. ACTION (RecyclerView, R.id.recyclerView, (), long_click, NULL): Long click on the first item in the shopping list to open the item options.
> 
> 3. ACTION (Button, R.id.delete, (), click, NULL): Click on the "Delete" button to initiate the deletion process.
> 
> 4. ACTION (Button, android.R.id.button1, (), click, NULL): Click on the "Okay" button in the confirmation dialog to confirm the deletion.
> 
> 5. ASSERT (RecyclerView, R.id.recyclerView, (), element_not_present, "deleted_item"): Verify that the deleted item is no longer present in the shopping list.
> ```
> 
> This function description outlines the steps to delete an item from a shopping list, including selecting the item, initiating the deletion, confirming the action, and verifying the item's removal. The ASSERT step at the end is added to ensure the deletion was successful, although it's not explicitly present in the original test case.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with selecting an item from the shopping list, but in the target app, we first need to navigate to a specific shopping list. Let's begin with that:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListNameTextView, (58, 106), click, "tomato"):Click on the shopping list named "tomato" to view its details and items
~~~

This action will open the specific shopping list, which should contain the items we need to interact with in the following steps.
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(58, 106)
···

This code uses the coordinates (58, 106) to click on the shopping list named "tomato". Since coordinates are provided and they are precise, we use them directly for the click action, which is the optimal choice as per the requirements.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to click on the first item in the shopping list. According to the executed action sequence, we have already clicked on a shopping list named "tomato". This action corresponds to opening a specific shopping list, which is a prerequisite for performing operations on individual items within that list.

Now, we need to proceed with the next step, which is to long-click on the first item in the shopping list. From the current page's intent description, we can see that there's an action that allows long-clicking on an item named "tomato". This seems to be the most appropriate action to match the next step in our source test case.

Here's the next action we should take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/itemNameTextView, (55, 115), long_click, "tomato"):Long click on the "tomato" item to open a context menu for further actions such as editing or deleting the item.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 in our source test case, where we long-click on the first item in the shopping list to open the item options. By performing this action, we should be able to access a context menu that includes a delete option, which will allow us to proceed with the subsequent steps in our test case migration.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d.long_click(55, 115, 1)
```

This code performs a long click action at the coordinates (55, 115) for 1 second, which corresponds to long-clicking on the "tomato" item in the shopping list. This action should open a context menu for further actions on the item.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (71, 129), click, "tomato"): Click on the item title "tomato". This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the current and next page JSONs are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (71, 129), long_click, "tomato"): Long click on the item "tomato" to open a context menu with options to Edit, Move to another list, and Delete the item.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (55, 163), click, NULL): Click to edit the item "tomato". This action does not navigate to a new page, but likely opens an edit dialog or form for the selected item.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (55, 163), long_click, NULL): Long click on the item to open a context menu with options to Edit, Move to another list, or Delete the item. The context menu remains open after the long click action.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I can determine that we are currently at step 3 of the source test case, which involves deleting an item from the shopping list. The executed actions so far match steps 1 and 2 of the source test case. Now, we need to proceed with the deletion process. Here's the next action to take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (55, 163), click, NULL):Click on the "Delete" option in the context menu to initiate the deletion process for the "tomato" item.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in the source test case, where we click on the "Delete" button. In the target app, it appears that the delete option is part of a context menu that opens after a long click, rather than a separate button. The coordinates (55, 163) suggest this is likely the position of the delete option in the context menu.
Based on the provided action description and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d.click(55, 163)
···

This code uses the coordinates (55, 163) to click on the "Delete" option in the context menu for the "tomato" item. Since precise coordinates are provided, we use them directly for the click action, as per the requirements.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/empty_listview_textview, (16, 115), longClick, "You have no items on the list. Add one using the button below."): Long click on the empty list view text. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes in the UI.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/fab, (238, 558), click, NULL): Click to add a new item to the shopping list. The next page is an "Add item" page with an input field for item name (id: pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/item_name_edit_text), quantity controls, unit selection, and a "SAVE" button (id: pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/addShoppingListButton).
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/fab, (238, 558), long_click, NULL): Long click on the floating action button to open the "Add item" page. The new page contains an "Item name" input field with id "pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/item_name_edit_text" and a "Quantity" input field with id "pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/item_quantity_edit_text".

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are in the process of deleting an item from a shopping list. Let's proceed with the next step in the migration process.

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/itemNameTextView, (55, 115), element_not_present, "tomato"):Verify that the "tomato" item has been successfully deleted from the shopping list.
~~~

This assertion step corresponds to step 5 in the source test case, where we verify that the deleted item is no longer present in the shopping list. We're using the same element (TextView) that was long-clicked earlier to check if it's no longer present, which would indicate successful deletion.

If this assertion passes, it would complete the migration of the test case. However, we should wait for confirmation of the assertion's success before concluding the migration.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
assert not d(resourceId="pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/itemNameTextView", text="tomato").exists()
```

This code checks that an element with the specified resource ID and text "tomato" does not exist on the screen, verifying that the "tomato" item has been successfully deleted from the shopping list.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated the test case for deleting an item from a shopping list. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next step:

1. We've clicked on the "tomato" shopping list.
2. We've long-clicked on the "tomato" item within the list.
3. We've clicked on the "Delete" option to remove the item.
4. We've verified that the "tomato" item is no longer present in the list.

These actions correspond to steps 1-5 of the source test case, with some adaptations to the target app's UI and functionality. The deletion process in the target app seems to be more straightforward, not requiring a confirmation dialog.

Given that we've completed all the steps from the source test case and verified the deletion, we can conclude that the test case migration is complete. Therefore, I'll respond with DONE:

~~~
DONE
~~~

This indicates that we have successfully migrated all steps of the source test case to the target app, adapting to its specific UI and functionality while maintaining the core purpose of the test: deleting an item from a shopping list and verifying its removal.
Thank you for providing the device variable name and the instructions. I understand that the device variable name is 'd' for this session. However, you haven't provided any specific actions to convert into UIAutomator2 code. The "DONE" at the end of your message suggests that there are no actions to process at this time.

If you have any specific actions you'd like me to convert into UIAutomator2 code, please provide them in the format you described earlier:

ACTION (element, id, coordinates, action, value):purpose

Once you provide the actions, I'll be happy to convert them into the appropriate UIAutomator2 code using the device variable 'd' and following the guidelines you've outlined.
