#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. Let's start with the first step of the source test case:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, org.openintents.shopping:id/list_items, (0, 104), click, NULL):Click on the first item in the shopping list
~~~

This action corresponds to the first step in the source test case, which is clicking on the first item in the shopping list. The ListView with id "org.openintents.shopping:id/list_items" appears to be the shopping list in the target app.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(0, 104)
···

This code uses the coordinates (0, 104) to click on the first item in the shopping list, as specified in the action description. Using coordinates is the preferred method according to the requirements, and it's the most precise way to interact with the specified element in this case.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case, it appears we have completed the first step of the test case. Now, we need to proceed with opening the overflow menu to select the "Check all" option. Let's analyze the current page's intentions to find the most appropriate action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (280, 28), click, NULL):Click to open options menu. The next page shows a menu with options including "New list", "Pick items", "Theme", "Settings", "Rename list", "Delete list", "Send list", "Mark all items", "Check updates", "About", and "Privacy".
~~~

This action seems to be the most suitable for opening the overflow menu, which is our next step in the test case migration. The "Mark all items" option in the menu description closely matches our goal of checking all items.
Based on the provided action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d.click(280, 28)
···

This code will click on the ImageButton at the coordinates (280, 28) to open the options menu. The use of coordinates is preferred as specified in the requirements, and it's the most precise way to interact with the element in this case.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the second step of the test case migration. The next step in the source test case is to click on the "Check all" option in the overflow menu. Let's find the closest match in the target app's current page intentions.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (136, 329), click, "Mark all items"):Click on "Mark all items" option to check all items in the shopping list
ASSERT (android.widget.ListView, org.openintents.shopping:id/list_items, (0, 104), withText, "Scheduled Item"):Verify that all items are checked successfully.
DONE
~~~

This action corresponds to the "Check all" functionality in the source test case. Although the exact wording is different ("Mark all items" instead of "Check all"), the purpose is the same. After executing this action, we should verify if all items have been checked.
Based on the provided action and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(136, 329)
assert d(resourceId="org.openintents.shopping:id/list_items").child(text="checked").exists()
···

This code uses the coordinates (136, 329) to click on the "Mark all items" option. Since coordinates are provided and they are precise, we prefer to use them over the resource ID or text attribute as per the requirements.
