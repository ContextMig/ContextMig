### Semantics of Source Test case
> Based on the provided Android test case, here's the corresponding function description following the specified format:
> 
> ```
> This test case is testing the functionality of filtering and removing items from a shopping list.
> 
> The detailed process with serial numbers is as follows:
> 
> 1. ACTION (Spinner, R.id.spinner_listfilter, (), click, NULL): Click on the list filter spinner to open the dropdown.
> 
> 2. ACTION (CheckedTextView, , (), click, NULL): Select the first item (at position 0) from the dropdown list.
> 
> 3. ACTION (TextView, R.id.name, (), long_click, NULL): Long click on the item with text "item2" in the shopping list.
> 
> 4. ACTION (TextView, android.R.id.title, (), click, NULL): Click on the "Remove item from list" option in the context menu.
> 
> 5. ASSERT (TextView, R.id.name, (), element_absence, "item2"): Verify that the item "item2" is no longer present in the shopping list.
> ```
> 
> Note: The last assertion (step 5) is inferred from the context of the test case, as it's a logical next step to verify the removal action, even though it's not explicitly stated in the original test code.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with filtering the shopping list, but the current page's intentions show that we are on a page displaying a list of shopping lists. To proceed with the test case, we need to first navigate to a specific shopping list. Here's the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListNameTextView, (58, 106), click, "Test Shopping List"):Click to open the "Test Shopping List" details page
~~~

This action will open the details of the "Test Shopping List", which should bring us to a page where we can perform operations on individual list items, aligning with the first step of the source test case.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d.click(58, 106)
```

This code uses the coordinates (58, 106) to click on the "Test Shopping List" item, which should open its details page. The coordinates are used as they provide the most precise method of interaction, as per the requirements.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in migrating the test case. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've opened a specific shopping list called "Test Shopping List".
2. The source test case starts with filtering the list, but our target app doesn't seem to have a direct filter option on this page.
3. The next step in the source test case is to long-click on an item to remove it.

Given these observations, we should proceed with finding an item in the list and attempting to remove it. Here's the next action I propose:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/item_list_view, (16, 115), long_click, NULL): Long click on an item in the shopping list to open the context menu for item removal.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in the source test case, where we long-click on an item to prepare for its removal. We're using the ListView that contains the shopping list items, as it's the closest match to the intended action in the source test case.
Based on the provided information, I will convert the action into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the corresponding code:

···
d.long_click(16, 115, 1)
···

This code performs a long click operation at the coordinates (16, 115) for 1 second, which should open the context menu for item removal in the shopping list as described in the action.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (32, 129), click, "hyy"): Click on the text "hyy" in the title bar. This does not seem to navigate to a new page based on the Next Page JSON provided, which appears identical to the Current Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (32, 129), long_click, "hyy"): Long click on the item title to open a context menu with options to Edit, Move to another list, and Delete the item.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (16, 163), click, NULL): Click to select the "Edit" option for the item "hyy". This action does not navigate to a new page, but likely opens an edit dialog or screen for the selected item.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (16, 163), long_click, NULL): Long click on the item to open a context menu with options to Edit, Move to another list, or Delete the item.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it seems we are currently at the step of removing an item from the shopping list. The executed actions indicate that we have successfully opened the "Test Shopping List" and long-clicked on an item to open the context menu. Here's my suggestion for the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android.R.id.title, (32, 129), click, "Delete"):purpose: Click on the "Delete" option in the context menu to remove the selected item from the shopping list.
~~~

This action aligns with step 4 of the source test case semantics, which states: "ACTION (TextView, android.R.id.title, (), click, NULL): Click on the 'Remove item from list' option in the context menu."

Please note that I have used the provided coordinates and the element ID "android.R.id.title" for the context menu option, assuming that the "Remove" option is a TextView element with that ID. If this assumption is incorrect, please provide the correct element details, and I will update my response accordingly.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d.click(32, 129)
···

This code uses the coordinates (32, 129) to click on the "Remove" option in the context menu. Since coordinates are provided and they are precise, we use them as the preferred method for interaction.

#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/empty_listview_textview, (16, 115), longClick, "You have no items on the list. Add one using the button below."): Long click on the empty list view text. This action does not lead to any visible changes in the UI or navigation to a new page.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/fab, (238, 558), click, NULL): Click to open the "Add item" page, which contains an item name input field (id: pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/item_name_edit_text), quantity controls, unit selection radio buttons, and a "SAVE" button (id: pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/addShoppingListButton).
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/fab, (238, 558), longClick, NULL): Long click on the floating action button to open the "Add item" page. The new page contains an "Item name" input field with id "pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/item_name_edit_text", quantity controls, unit selection radio buttons, and a "SAVE" button with id "pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/addShoppingListButton".

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've opened the "Test Shopping List" details page.
2. We've long-clicked on an item in the shopping list to open the context menu.
3. We've clicked on the "Remove" option to remove the selected item.

The next logical step would be to verify that the item has been removed from the list. This corresponds to step 5 in the source test case. Here's the appropriate action:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.ListView, pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/item_list_view, (16, 115), element_absence):Verify that the removed item is no longer present in the shopping list
~~~

This assertion checks that the removed item is no longer present in the list view. Since we don't have the exact text of the removed item, we're using a general assertion to check for the absence of the removed element.
Based on the provided action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
assert not d(resourceId="pl.com.andrzejgrzyb.shoppinglist:id/item_list_view").child(className="android.widget.ListView").exists
···

This code checks for the absence of the ListView element within the specified resource ID. If the element is not found, the assertion will pass, confirming that the removed item is no longer present in the shopping list.
