## s4's Test3 to s2

### Semantics of Source Test case
> Based on the provided Android test case, here's the corresponding function description following the specified format:
> 
> ```
> This test case is testing the functionality of filtering and removing items from a shopping list.
> 
> The detailed process with serial numbers is as follows:
> 
> 1. ACTION (Spinner, R.id.spinner_listfilter, (), click, NULL): Click on the list filter spinner to open the dropdown.
> 
> 2. ACTION (CheckedTextView, , (), click, NULL): Select the first item (at position 0) from the dropdown list.
> 
> 3. ACTION (TextView, R.id.name, (), long_click, NULL): Long click on the item with text "item2" in the shopping list.
> 
> 4. ACTION (TextView, android.R.id.title, (), click, NULL): Click on the "Remove item from list" option in the context menu.
> 
> 5. ASSERT (TextView, R.id.name, (), element_absence, "item2"): Verify that the item "item2" is no longer present in the shopping list.
> ```
> 
> Note: The last assertion (step 5) is inferred from the context of the test case, as it's a logical next step to verify the removal action, even though it's not explicitly stated in the original test code.

Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to click on a list filter spinner. However, in the current page's intent description, there is no direct equivalent to a spinner for list filtering. Instead, we have a list of shopping lists.

Given this context, we should start by opening one of the shopping lists, which is the closest match to interacting with a list filter. Here's the suggested next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/nameShoppingList, (45, 82), click, "list1"):Click to open the "list1" shopping list to view its contents
~~~

This action opens a specific shopping list, which is a logical first step in our test case migration. It allows us to proceed to the next steps that involve interacting with list items.
Here is the UIAutomator2 code for the given action:

```
d.click(45, 82)
d(resourceId="br.com.activity:id/nameShoppingList").set_text("list1")
```

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to click on a list filter spinner. However, the current page's intentions don't show a direct match for this action. Let's proceed with the closest matching action that aligns with the overall goal of the test case.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (264, 24), click, NULL):Click to open the options menu to access filtering options
~~~

This action opens the options menu, which is likely to contain filtering options similar to the spinner in the source test case. We're adapting to the target app's structure while maintaining the functional intent of the source test case.
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(264, 24)
···

This code will perform a click action at the coordinates (264, 24), which corresponds to the ImageButton that opens the options menu for accessing filtering options. Using coordinates is the preferred method as specified in the requirements, and it's also the most precise way to interact with the UI element in this case.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided information, it seems we are attempting to migrate the first step of the source test case. However, the execution of the filter spinner action has failed. Let's try an alternative approach to achieve the filtering functionality based on the current page's intentions.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (116, 72), long_click, NULL):Long click to open the options menu, which displays various actions including Search
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (132, 83), click, "Search"):Click to open the search functionality for filtering items in the shopping list
~~~

Explanation:
1. Since the direct interaction with the spinner failed, we're attempting to access the filtering functionality through the search feature, which is commonly used for filtering items in shopping list apps.
2. We first long-click to open the options menu, then click on the "Search" option to open the search functionality.
3. This approach aims to provide a similar filtering capability as intended in the source test case, even though the exact UI elements differ.

If this action succeeds, we can proceed with entering a search term in the next step to filter the list items, which would be functionally similar to selecting an item from the filter dropdown in the source test case.
Here is the UIAutomator2 code for the given actions:

```
d(resourceId="android.widget.LinearLayout", index=0).long_click(1)
d(resourceId="android:id/title", text="Search").click()
```

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it seems we are currently at the step of filtering items in the shopping list. The source test case is trying to use a spinner for filtering, but in the target app, we're using a search functionality instead. Let's proceed with the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, android:id/search_src_text, (59, 29), click, NULL):Click on the search box to enter text for filtering items in the list
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, android:id/search_src_text, (59, 29), input, "item2"):Enter "item2" in the search box to filter the list and find the specific item
~~~

This action corresponds to steps 1 and 2 in the source test case, where we're trying to filter the list to find a specific item. Instead of using a spinner, we're using the search functionality in the target app. 

After this, we should be able to see "item2" in the filtered list, allowing us to proceed with the next steps of the test case.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code for the given actions:

```
d.click(59, 29)
d(resourceId="android:id/search_src_text").set_text("item2")
```

Explanation:

1. `d.click(59, 29)`: This clicks on the coordinates (59, 29), which corresponds to the search box (android.widget.EditText).
2. `d(resourceId="android:id/search_src_text").set_text("item2")`: This sets the text "item2" in the search box identified by the resource ID "android:id/search_src_text".

Note: The code assumes that the coordinates and resource ID provided in the input are accurate and unique within the application's UI hierarchy.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully navigated to the shopping list and initiated a search for "item2". This corresponds to steps 1 and 2 in the source test case, although the implementation differs slightly. Now, we need to proceed with the next step, which is to remove the item "item2" from the list.

Here's the next action to take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TableLayout, , (5, 159), long_click, NULL):Long click on the item "item2" to open the deletion confirmation dialog
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in the source test case, where we long-click on the item to be removed. In the target app, this action opens a deletion confirmation dialog, which is slightly different from the source app's behavior but serves the same purpose of initiating the item removal process.
```
d(className="android.widget.TableLayout").long_click(5, 159, 1)
```

This code performs a long click operation on the UI element of type `android.widget.TableLayout` at the coordinates (5, 159) for 1 second duration, which should open the deletion confirmation dialog for the "item2" item based on the provided description.

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully filtered the list to show "item2", but the long-click action to open the deletion confirmation dialog failed. Let's try an alternative approach to remove the item. We'll attempt to long-click on the specific TextView containing "item2".

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/descriptionItemShoppingList, (5, 169), long_click, "item2"):Long click on the item to open a deletion confirmation dialog
~~~
Understood. Here's the UIAutomator2 code to perform the specified action:

```
d.long_click(5, 169)
```

This code will long-click on the UI element at coordinates (5, 169), which corresponds to the android.widget.TextView with the resource ID "br.com.activity:id/descriptionItemShoppingList" and should open a deletion confirmation dialog for the item named "item2".

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully located and long-clicked on the "item2" item, which has opened a deletion confirmation dialog. This corresponds to steps 3 and 4 in the source test case. The next logical step would be to confirm the deletion. Here's the next action to take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (), click, NULL):Click on the "Yes" button to confirm the deletion of "item2" from the shopping list
~~~

This action aims to complete step 4 of the source test case by removing the item from the list. After this action, we should verify that the item has been removed, which corresponds to step 5 in the source test case.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d(resourceId="android:id/button1").click()
···

This code uses the resourceId to locate and click the "Yes" button, confirming the deletion of "item2" from the shopping list. Since the resourceId is provided and it's a standard Android system ID, it's likely to be unique and reliable, making it preferable over coordinates in this case.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the source test case semantics, the executed action sequence, and the current page's intentions, it seems we are currently at step 3 of the source test case:

```
3. ACTION (TextView, R.id.name, (), long_click, NULL): Long click on the item with text "item2" in the shopping list.
```

You have already successfully executed the following actions:

1. Opened the "list1" shopping list
2. Clicked on the filter spinner (but failed to open the dropdown)
3. Opened the search functionality
4. Entered "item2" in the search box to filter the list
5. Long-clicked on the "item2" item to open the deletion confirmation dialog

The next step should be to confirm the deletion of "item2" from the shopping list. Looking at the current page's intentions, I can see the following relevant action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (), click, NULL):Click on the "Yes" button to confirm the deletion of "item2" from the shopping list
~~~

So, my recommendation for the next step would be:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (), click, NULL):Confirm the deletion of "item2" from the shopping list
~~~

After this action, we should be able to proceed to step 4 of the source test case:

```
4. ACTION (TextView, android.R.id.title, (), click, NULL): Click on the "Remove item from list" option in the context menu.
```

However, since the target app's UI and flow might differ from the source app, we'll have to analyze the next page's intentions after executing the above action to determine the appropriate next step.
Based on the provided actions, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

```
# Long click on the item with text "item2" in the shopping list
d(text="item2").long_click(1)

# Click on the "Remove item from list" option in the context menu
d(resourceId="android:id/title", text="Remove item from list").click()

# Click on the "Yes" button to confirm the deletion of "item2"
d(resourceId="android:id/button1").click()

# Confirm the deletion of "item2" from the shopping list
d(resourceId="android:id/button1").click()
```

This code follows the sequence of actions described, using the text attribute for the long click operation and the resourceId for the subsequent clicks. The long click duration is set to 1 second as required. The code avoids duplicates and uses the most appropriate selectors based on the information provided.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information and the current state of the test case migration, here's the next step I recommend:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (189, 153), click, NULL):Click on the "Yes" button to confirm the deletion of "item2" from the shopping list
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've successfully reached step 3 and 4 of the source test case, where we long-clicked on the "item2" item and opened the context menu.
2. The next logical step is to confirm the deletion of the item, which corresponds to step 4 in the source test case: "Click on the 'Remove item from list' option in the context menu."
3. In the target app, this action seems to be represented by clicking the "Yes" button in the deletion confirmation dialog.
4. Although this action has failed twice before, it's still the most logical next step. The failure might be due to timing issues or the button not being fully loaded. We'll try one more time with the specific coordinates provided in the intentions list.

If this action fails again, we may need to consider alternative approaches or investigate why the button is not clickable.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(189, 153)
···

This code uses the coordinates (189, 153) to click on the "Yes" button to confirm the deletion of "item2" from the shopping list. The coordinate-based approach is preferred as per the requirements, and it's the most precise method to interact with the specific UI element in this case.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information and the executed action sequence, I can see that we have successfully completed steps 3 and 4 of the source test case. We long-clicked on the item "item2" and confirmed its deletion. The next step in the source test case is to verify that the item "item2" is no longer present in the shopping list. Let's proceed with this verification:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/descriptionItemShoppingList, (5, 169), element_absence, "item2"):Verify that the item "item2" is no longer present in the shopping list
DONE
~~~

This assertion checks for the absence of the "item2" text in the shopping list, which corresponds to step 5 in the source test case. 

I've included the DONE statement because we have now successfully migrated all steps of the source test case to the target app. We've performed the filtering (through search), removal of the specific item, and verification of its absence, which covers all the functionalities described in the source test case.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to verify the absence of "item2" in the shopping list:

```
assert not d(resourceId="br.com.activity:id/descriptionItemShoppingList", text="item2").exists()
```

This code checks that an element with the specified resource ID and text "item2" does not exist on the screen, effectively verifying that "item2" is no longer present in the shopping list.
