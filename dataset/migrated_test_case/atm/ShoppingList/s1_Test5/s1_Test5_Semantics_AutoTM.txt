0Based on the provided Android test case, I'll generate a corresponding function description following the specified format:

```
This test case is testing the functionality of deleting an item from a shopping list and verifying the empty list message.

The detailed process with serial numbers is as follows:

1. ACTION (LinearLayout, R.id.shopping_lists_list_view, (0), click, NULL): Click on the first shopping list in the main view.

2. ACTION (TextView, R.id.itemNameTextView, (0), long_click, NULL): Long-click on the name of the first item in the selected shopping list.

3. ACTION (TextView, android.R.id.title, (), click, NULL): Click on the "Delete" option in the context menu.

4. ASSERT (TextView, R.id.empty_listview_textview, (), matches, "You have no items on the list. Add one using the button below."): Verify that the empty list message is displayed correctly after deleting the item.
```

This function description outlines the key steps in the test case, including selecting a shopping list, deleting an item, and verifying the empty list message. Each step is numbered and formatted according to the specified structure, using ACTION for interactions and ASSERT for verification.
