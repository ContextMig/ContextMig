#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with selecting a shopping list, so we should find a similar action in the target app. Let's proceed with the first step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/nameShoppingList, (45, 82), click, "family"):Click on the first shopping list to view its details
~~~

This action corresponds to the first step in the source test case, where we click on a shopping list to view its contents. The "family" shopping list seems to be the first one available in the target app, so we'll use that for our migration.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(45, 82)
···

This code uses the coordinates (45, 82) to click on the first shopping list, which should open its details. The coordinate-based approach is preferred as per the requirements, and it's the most precise method to interact with the specified element.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/descriptionItemShoppingList, (37, 174), long_click, "Hh"):Long-click on the first item in the shopping list to open the deletion confirmation dialog
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already completed the first step of the source test case by clicking on a shopping list (in this case, "family").
2. The next step in the source test case is to long-click on the first item in the shopping list.
3. In the target app, we have an intention that matches this action: long-clicking on the item description ("Hh") opens a deletion confirmation dialog, which aligns with the source test case's intention to delete an item.
4. The element type (TextView) and the action (long_click) match the source test case.

This action should open the deletion confirmation dialog, setting up for the next step in the test case migration.
Based on the provided information, I'll convert the action into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the code:

```
d.long_click(37, 174, 1)
```

This code performs a long click at the coordinates (37, 174) for 1 second, which corresponds to long-clicking on the first item in the shopping list to open the deletion confirmation dialog. The use of coordinates is preferred as per the requirements, and the long click duration is set to 1 second as specified in the common operations.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (32, 259), click, "Excluir?"): Click on the alert title. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the dialog remains open with the same elements: a message, a "No" button (id: android:id/button2), and a "Yes" button (id: android:id/button1).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (32, 259), long_click, "Excluir?"): Long click on the alert title. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes in the UI.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (16, 308), click, "Do you want to delete the item 'Hh'?"): Click on the message to view the deletion confirmation. The dialog remains open with "No" (id: android:id/button2) and "Yes" (id: android:id/button1) buttons for user decision.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (16, 308), long_click, "Do you want to delete the item 'Hh'?"): Long click on the confirmation message. This action does not navigate to a new page or reveal new elements, as the dialog remains unchanged after the long click.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (16, 373), click, "No"): Click to cancel the deletion of item 'Hh'. The page returns to the previous shopping list view with the item 'Hh' still present in the list view (br.com.activity:id/lvItemShoppingList).
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (16, 373), long_click, "No"): Long-click on the "No" button to cancel the deletion of the item 'Hh'. The page returns to the shopping list view with the item 'Hh' still present, containing an "Add an item" EditText with id "br.com.activity:id/edDescription" and a ListView with id "br.com.activity:id/lvItemShoppingList".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (160, 373), click, "Yes"): Click to confirm deletion of the item 'Hh'. After clicking, the item is removed from the shopping list and the list view (br.com.activity:id/lvItemShoppingList) now displays "No item was added".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (160, 373), long_click, "Yes"): Long click on the "Yes" button to confirm and delete the item 'Hh'. After this action, the page returns to the shopping list view where the deleted item is no longer present, and the list shows "No item was added" with id "br.com.activity:id/header_description_collumn".

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we can proceed with the next step in the test case migration. The source test case is currently at step 3, which involves clicking on the "Delete" option in the context menu. In the target application, we are presented with a deletion confirmation dialog. Let's proceed with the appropriate action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (160, 373), click, "Yes"):Click to confirm deletion of the item 'Hh'
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in the source test case, where we confirm the deletion of the item. By clicking the "Yes" button, we are effectively deleting the item from the shopping list, which aligns with the intention of the original test case.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the provided action:

···
d.click(160, 373)
···

This code uses the coordinates (160, 373) to click on the "Yes" button to confirm the deletion of the item 'Hh'. I've used the coordinates as they were provided and precise, which is the preferred method according to the requirements.

ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (0, 24), click, NULL): Click on the "family, Navigate up" button to return to the main Shopping List page. The next page displays a list of shopping lists with elements like "br.com.activity:id/lvShoppingList" (ListView) containing multiple shopping list items, each with a name (id: "br.com.activity:id/nameShoppingList"), date (id: "br.com.activity:id/dateShoppingList"), and time (id: "br.com.activity:id/timeShoppingList").
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (0, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click on the "family, Navigate up" button to return to the Shopping List page, which displays a list of shopping lists with "br.com.activity:id/lvShoppingList" ListView containing multiple shopping list items, each with a name, date, and time.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/action_bar_title, (49, 35), click, "family"): Click on the title "family" to navigate back to the main Shopping List page. The new page displays a list of shopping lists with a "New list" option (id: br.com.activity:id/action_add) and a scrollable list view of existing shopping lists (id: br.com.activity:id/lvShoppingList).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/action_bar_title, (49, 35), long_click, "family"): Long click on the action bar title to return to the main Shopping List page. The new page displays a list of shopping lists with items having ids "br.com.activity:id/nameShoppingList", "br.com.activity:id/dateShoppingList", and "br.com.activity:id/timeShoppingList".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/action_done, (208, 24), click, NULL): Click to add an item to the shopping list. The page remains the same after clicking, with no new elements added.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/action_done, (208, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click on the "Add item" button. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the current and next page JSONs are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (264, 24), click, NULL): Click to open the options menu. The menu contains items such as "Search", "Check all", "Delete checked", "Delete all", "Barcode scan", "Share", and "Settings".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (264, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click on the "More options" button to open additional menu options. The action does not lead to a new page, but may display a popup menu with additional actions.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, br.com.activity:id/edDescription, (5, 77), click, NULL): Click to focus on the "Add an item" input field. This action prepares the field for text entry but does not navigate to a new page or show new widgets.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, br.com.activity:id/edDescription, (5, 77), long_click, "Add an item"): Long press on the "Add an item" input field. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes in the UI.
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, br.com.activity:id/lvItemShoppingList, (5, 117), click, NULL): Click on the shopping list to potentially add or view items. No change in page or new widgets appear after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, br.com.activity:id/lvItemShoppingList, (5, 117), long_click, NULL): Long click on the empty shopping list. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes in the UI.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/header_description_collumn, (15, 127), click, "No item was added"): Click on the "No item was added" text. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes in the UI.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/header_description_collumn, (15, 127), long_click, "No item was added"): Long click on the "No item was added" text. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the page content remains the same after the long click.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I can determine that we are currently at the step of verifying the empty list message after deleting an item from the shopping list. Let's proceed with the next step in the test migration:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/header_description_collumn, (15, 127), matches, "No item was added"):Verify that the empty list message is displayed correctly after deleting the item
~~~

This assertion step corresponds to step 4 in the source test case, where we verify that an empty list message is displayed after deleting an item. In the target app, the message "No item was added" serves the same purpose as the "You have no items on the list" message in the source app.

The assertion checks if the TextView with id "br.com.activity:id/header_description_collumn" contains the text "No item was added", which indicates that the list is empty after the deletion.

If this assertion passes, it confirms that the deletion operation was successful and the app is correctly displaying the empty state of the shopping list.
Based on the provided action, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the assertion:

···
assert d(resourceId="br.com.activity:id/header_description_collumn").get_text() == "No item was added"
···

This code checks if the TextView with the specified resource ID contains the text "No item was added", which verifies that the empty list message is displayed correctly after deleting the item.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated the test case for deleting an item from a shopping list and verifying the empty list message. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We clicked on the first shopping list (named "family").
2. We long-clicked on the first item in the list (named "Hh").
3. We confirmed the deletion by clicking "Yes" on the confirmation dialog.
4. We verified that the empty list message "No item was added" is displayed.

These steps correspond to all the steps in the source test case. The only difference is that the target app uses a confirmation dialog for deletion, which is an additional step compared to the source app.

Given that we have completed all the steps from the source test case and verified the empty list message, we can conclude that the test case migration is complete. Therefore, I will respond with DONE.
