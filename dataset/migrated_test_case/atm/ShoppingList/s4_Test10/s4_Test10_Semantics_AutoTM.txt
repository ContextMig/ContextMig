Based on the provided Android test case, here's the corresponding function description following the specified format:

```
This test case is testing the theme selection functionality in the shopping list application.

The detailed process with serial numbers is as follows:

1. ACTION (OptionsMenu, , (), click, NULL): Open the options menu by clicking on the overflow menu button.

2. ACTION (TextView, android.R.id.title, (), click, NULL): Click on the "Theme" option in the opened menu.

3. ACTION (CheckedTextView, R.id.list1, (), click, NULL): Select the first theme option from the list of available themes.

4. ACTION (Button, android.R.id.button1, (), click, NULL): Click the "OK" button to confirm the theme selection.

5. ASSERT (Activity, , (), isDisplayed, NULL): Verify that the main activity is displayed with the newly selected theme.
```

This test case checks the ability to change the application's theme through the options menu. It opens the menu, selects the theme option, chooses a specific theme, and confirms the selection. The final assertion implicitly checks if the theme change was successful by verifying that the main activity is still displayed after the theme change.
