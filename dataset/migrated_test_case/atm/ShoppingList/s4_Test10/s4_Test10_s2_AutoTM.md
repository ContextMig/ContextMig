### Semantics of Source Test case
> Based on the provided Android test case, here's the corresponding function description following the specified format:
> 
> ```
> This test case is testing the theme selection functionality in the shopping list application.
> 
> The detailed process with serial numbers is as follows:
> 
> 1. ACTION (OptionsMenu, , (), click, NULL): Open the options menu by clicking on the overflow menu button.
> 
> 2. ACTION (TextView, android.R.id.title, (), click, NULL): Click on the "Theme" option in the opened menu.
> 
> 3. ACTION (CheckedTextView, R.id.list1, (), click, NULL): Select the first theme option from the list of available themes.
> 
> 4. ACTION (Button, android.R.id.button1, (), click, NULL): Click the "OK" button to confirm the theme selection.
> 
> 5. ASSERT (Activity, , (), isDisplayed, NULL): Verify that the main activity is displayed with the newly selected theme.
> ```
> 
> This test case checks the ability to change the application's theme through the options menu. It opens the menu, selects the theme option, chooses a specific theme, and confirms the selection. The final assertion implicitly checks if the theme change was successful by verifying that the main activity is still displayed after the theme change.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with opening the options menu, so we should look for a similar action in the target app. Let's proceed with the first step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (264, 24), click, NULL):Click to open options menu
~~~

This action corresponds to the first step in the source test case, which is opening the options menu. In the target app, we have an ImageButton that opens the options menu when clicked, so this is the most appropriate action to start with.
Based on the provided action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

```
d.click(264, 24)
```

This code uses the device variable name 'd' as specified, and performs a click action at the coordinates (264, 24) to open the options menu. Since the coordinates are provided and precise, they are used directly in the click operation, which is the optimal choice as per the requirements.

#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (116, 72), click, NULL): Click to select "Delete all" option. This action does not navigate to a new page, but may trigger a confirmation dialog or perform the delete all operation.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (116, 72), long_click, NULL): Long press on the shopping list item to open the context menu with options for "Delete all", "Software update", and "Settings".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (132, 83), click, "Delete all"): Click to open a confirmation dialog for deleting all shopping lists. The dialog includes a title "Excluir?" (id: android:id/alertTitle), a message (id: android:id/message), and two buttons: "No" (id: android:id/button2) and "Yes" (id: android:id/button1).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (132, 83), longClick, "Delete all"): Long click to open a confirmation dialog for deleting all shopping lists. The dialog contains a title "Excluir?" (id: android:id/alertTitle), a message (id: android:id/message), and two buttons: "No" (id: android:id/button2) and "Yes" (id: android:id/button1).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (132, 83), long_click, "Delete all"): Long-click on "Delete all" option. This action does not navigate to a new page, but may trigger a confirmation dialog or initiate the process of deleting all shopping lists.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in migrating the test case from the source application to the target application. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. The source test case is about theme selection functionality.
2. In the target app, we've already clicked on the options menu (ImageButton).
3. The current page's intentions don't show any theme-related options, but instead focus on delete and settings options.

Given this scenario, we need to adapt our approach. Since there's no direct theme option visible, we'll try to find the closest match to continue the test case migration. The "Settings" option seems to be the most likely place where theme settings might be located.

Here's the next step I propose:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (132, 83), click, "Settings"):Click on the "Settings" option to potentially access theme settings
~~~

This action attempts to navigate to the Settings page, where we might find theme-related options. If this action is successful, we'll need to reassess the new page's intentions to continue the migration process.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the requested action:

```
d.click(132, 83)
```

This code uses the coordinates (132, 83) to click on the "Settings" option. Since coordinates are provided and they are precise, this is the optimal choice for the action as per the requirements.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (32, 259), click, "Excluir?"): Click on the alert title. Clicking this element does not navigate to a new page or trigger any changes, as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (32, 259), long_click, "Excluir?"): Long click on the alert title. This action does not lead to a new page or create new widgets. The dialog with confirmation message and "Yes"/"No" buttons remains unchanged.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (16, 308), click, "Do you want to delete all the shopping lists?"): Click on the message to read the confirmation prompt. No new page or widgets appear after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (16, 308), long_click, "Do you want to delete all the shopping lists?"): Long click on the confirmation message. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (16, 373), click, "No"): Click the "No" button to cancel the deletion of all shopping lists. The page returns to the main shopping list view, which contains a ListView with id "br.com.activity:id/lvShoppingList" displaying multiple shopping list items.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (16, 373), long_click, "No"): Long click on the "No" button to dismiss the delete confirmation dialog. After this action, the app returns to the main shopping list page with multiple shopping list items displayed in a ListView with id "br.com.activity:id/lvShoppingList".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (160, 373), click, "Yes"): Click to confirm deletion of all shopping lists. After clicking, the page returns to the main shopping list view with an empty list and an "Add a new list" option with id "br.com.activity:id/nameShoppingList".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (160, 373), long_click, "Yes"): Long click on the "Yes" button to confirm deletion of all shopping lists. This action navigates to the main Shopping List page, which contains a "New list" button with id "br.com.activity:id/action_add" and an "Add a new list" text field with id "br.com.activity:id/nameShoppingList".

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case is about changing the theme of a shopping list application, while the executed actions in the target app have opened the options menu and clicked on "Settings". Let's proceed with the next step in the migration process.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (), click, NULL):Click on the "Theme" option in the settings menu to access theme selection
~~~

This action attempts to find and click on a "Theme" option within the settings menu, which aligns with step 2 of the source test case. We're assuming that the theme settings are located within the general settings menu in the target app. If this action is successful, we should see a list of theme options in the next step.
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d(text="Theme").click()
···

This code uses the text attribute to locate and click the "Theme" option in the settings menu. Since no specific coordinates were provided and the text is confirmed, using the text attribute is the most reliable method for this action.

ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (9, 24), click, NULL): Click on the app title bar to return to the main shopping list page. The page remains unchanged, showing the "Add a new list" option and action buttons for creating a new list and accessing more options.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (9, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click on the top bar to potentially access additional options or settings. No new page or dialog appears after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/action_bar_title, (49, 35), click, "Shopping List"): Click on the "Shopping List" title. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the Current Page JSON and Next Page JSON are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/action_bar_title, (49, 35), long_click, "Shopping List"): Long click on the action bar title. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes in the UI based on the provided JSON data.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/action_add, (208, 24), click, NULL): Click to add a new shopping list. A dialog appears with a title "Save?", an input field for the new list name, and "Cancel" and "OK" buttons.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/action_add, (208, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click on the "New list" button. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, suggesting it might not have a specific function or the long-click action is not implemented for this button.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (264, 24), click, NULL): Click to open more options menu. The menu contains options for "Delete all", "Software update", and "Settings".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (264, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click on "More options" button to open additional menu options. The action does not navigate to a new page or create new visible elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TableLayout, , (5, 77), click, NULL): Click to add a new shopping list. A dialog appears with a title "Save?", an editable text field, and "Cancel" and "OK" buttons to confirm or cancel the new list creation.
ACTION (android.widget.TableLayout, , (5, 77), long_click, NULL): Long click on the "Add a new list" area to open a dialog for creating a new shopping list. The dialog contains an EditText field for entering the list name, and "Cancel" and "OK" buttons with ids "android:id/button2" and "android:id/button1" respectively.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/nameShoppingList, (13, 82), click, "Add a new list"): Click to open a dialog for creating a new shopping list. The dialog contains an EditText for entering the list name, and buttons for "Cancel" (id: android:id/button2) and "OK" (id: android:id/button1).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, br.com.activity:id/nameShoppingList, (13, 82), long_click, "Add a new list"): Long click to open a dialog for creating a new shopping list. The dialog contains an EditText for entering the list name, and "Cancel" and "OK" buttons with ids "android:id/button2" and "android:id/button1" respectively.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we've successfully opened the options menu and navigated to the Settings page. However, the attempt to click on a "Theme" option in the settings menu failed. This suggests that the theme selection process in the target app might be different from the source app. Let's try to find an alternative way to access the theme settings or adjust our approach.

Given that we're now in the Settings page, let's look for options that might be related to theming or appearance. If we can't find a direct "Theme" option, we might need to explore other settings that could lead us to theme selection.

Here's the next step I propose:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, android:id/list, (0, 72), click, NULL):Scroll through the settings list to look for theme-related options
~~~

This action aims to interact with the settings list, allowing us to explore the available options. We're looking for anything related to themes, appearance, or display settings. 

After executing this action, we should be able to see more settings options, which will help us determine the next appropriate step in migrating the theme selection test case.
Based on the given action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the requested action:

```
d(resourceId="android:id/list").scroll.to(text="Theme")
```

This code scrolls through the ListView with the resource ID "android:id/list" to find an item containing the text "Theme". This approach is more reliable than using coordinates for scrolling, as it adapts to different screen sizes and resolutions.

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we've successfully opened the options menu and navigated to the Settings page. However, we're encountering difficulties in finding the specific "Theme" option. Let's try to explore the Settings page further to locate theme-related options or an alternative path to achieve our goal.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, android:id/list, (0, 72), swipe_up, NULL):Scroll up the settings list to look for theme-related options
~~~

This action will help us explore more options in the Settings menu, potentially revealing a theme-related setting that wasn't immediately visible.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the action:

```
d.swipe(0, 500, 0, 100)
```

This code performs a swipe gesture on the ListView to scroll it upwards. The swipe starts from (0, 500) and ends at (0, 100), which should effectively scroll the list upwards. The exact coordinates may need adjustment based on the device's screen size and the list's position, but this should work as a general solution for scrolling up a list view.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information and the executed action sequence, it appears that we are currently in the Settings menu of the target application, trying to find the theme selection option. However, the theme option is not immediately visible, and we had to scroll up the settings list. Let's continue with the next step in our test migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (), click, NULL):Click on the "Theme" option if it's visible after scrolling
~~~

This action attempts to find and click on the "Theme" option in the settings list, assuming it became visible after scrolling. We're trying to match step 2 of the source test case, which involves selecting the "Theme" option. 

If this action is successful, we'll be able to proceed to the theme selection screen. If it fails, we might need to explore other options or consider that the theme selection might be located differently in this application.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d(text="Theme").click()
```

This code assumes that the "Theme" option is visible on the screen. If it's not immediately visible and requires scrolling, you might need to add a scrolling action before the click. However, since the exact location or need for scrolling isn't specified in the action description, I've provided the most straightforward implementation based on the given information.

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it seems that we're in the Settings menu but haven't been able to locate a specific "Theme" option. Let's try to find an alternative way to change the theme or explore other settings that might be related to appearance. Here's the next step I suggest:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, android:id/list, (0, 72), swipe_up, NULL):Continue scrolling up the settings list to look for theme-related or appearance options
~~~

This action will continue to explore the settings menu by scrolling up, which might reveal more options that we haven't seen yet. We're looking for anything related to themes, appearance, or display settings that could potentially allow us to change the app's look.
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

```
d.swipe(0, 72, 0, 0)
```

This code performs a swipe-up action on the ListView, starting from the coordinates (0, 72) and moving upwards. The end coordinates are set to (0, 0) to ensure a full upward swipe. This action will scroll the settings list upwards, allowing the user to look for theme-related or appearance options that might be further down the list.

Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case semantics, it appears that we are currently trying to find the theme settings in the target application. The source test case involves changing the theme, but the target app's structure seems different. Let's continue our search for theme-related settings.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, android:id/list, (0, 72), swipe_up, NULL):Continue scrolling up the settings list to look for theme-related or appearance options
~~~

This action continues our search for theme settings by scrolling up the list. We're persisting with this approach because we haven't yet found a direct "Theme" option, and it's possible that the theme settings might be under a different name or category in this app.
Based on the provided action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.swipe(0, 720, 0, 72)
···

This code performs a swipe gesture from the bottom to the top of the screen, effectively scrolling up the settings list. The swipe starts at coordinates (0, 720) and ends at (0, 72), which represents a significant upward movement on the screen. This should allow the user to continue scrolling through the settings list to look for theme-related or appearance options.
