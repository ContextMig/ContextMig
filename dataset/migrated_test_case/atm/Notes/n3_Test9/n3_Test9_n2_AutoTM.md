#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with creating a new note, so we should look for a similar action in the target app. Let's proceed with the first step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/newNote, (530, 1410), click, NULL): Click to create a new note
~~~

This action corresponds to the first two steps of the source test case (clicking the floating action button and creating a new note). In the target app, we can directly create a new note with a single click.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(530, 1410)
···

This code uses the coordinates (530, 1410) to perform a click action, which will create a new note as described in the action. Using coordinates is the preferred method as per the requirements, and it's also the most precise way to interact with the UI element in this case.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL): Click on the back button to return to the previous page. A dialog appears asking to save changes, with "NO" (id: android:id/button2) and "YES" (id: android:id/button1) options.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), longClick, NULL): Long click on the back button to trigger a confirmation dialog for saving changes. The dialog contains a message "Save changes?" with id "android:id/message", and two buttons: "NO" with id "android:id/button2" and "YES" with id "android:id/button1".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/action_note_colour, (544, 72), click, NULL): Opens a color picker dialog to change the note color. The dialog has a title "Change note colour" and a 3x3 grid of color options represented by clickable FrameLayout elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/action_note_colour, (592.0, 120.0), longClick, NULL): Long click on the "Note colour" button to open a color selection dialog or menu. The action doesn't navigate to a new page, but may display a color picker overlay or popup.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (640, 72), click, NULL): Click on "更多选项" to open a popup menu with options "Note font size" and "Hide note body in list".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (680.0, 120.0), longClick, NULL): Long click on the "More options" button to open a menu with additional note editing options. The action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the current and next page JSON are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleEdit, (0, 176), click, "Title"): Click to edit the title of the note. The page remains the same, allowing the user to input text in the title field.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleEdit, (360.0, 226.0), longClick, "Title"): Long click on the title edit field to open the text selection menu. The page remains the same after this action, but a context menu with options like cut, copy, and paste may appear.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyEdit, (0, 292), click, "Note"): Click on the note body input field to enter or edit the content of the note. The page remains the same after this action, allowing the user to input text into the note body.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyEdit, (360.0, 316.5), longClick, "Note"): Long click on the note body to open a context menu with a "Paste" option, allowing users to paste content into the note.

Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. The source test case has created a new note, and we've successfully executed the action to create a new note in the target app. Now, we need to proceed with using keyboard shortcuts to input special characters.

However, the target app doesn't seem to have explicit keyboard shortcuts like the source app. Instead, we'll need to input these characters directly into the note body. Here's the next step in the migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyEdit, (0, 292), click, NULL):Click on the note body to begin editing
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyEdit, (0, 292), input, "*-_#!:>()[]"):Input the special characters that were added using shortcuts in the source app
~~~

This action combines steps 3-12 from the source test case into a single step in the target app. We're directly inputting the special characters into the note body, as the target app doesn't appear to have specific keyboard shortcuts for these characters.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given actions:

···
d.click(0, 292)
d.send_keys("*-_#!:>()")
···

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the note body at the specified coordinates (0, 292) to begin editing.
2. Inputs the special characters "*-_#!:>()" into the note body.

Note that I used the coordinates (0, 292) for both actions as they were provided and are preferred according to the requirements. The device variable name 'd' is used as specified in the input. The input action is performed using d.send_keys() as per the given instructions for setting text to an input box.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL): Click the back button to navigate back, which prompts a "Save changes?" dialog with "NO" (id: android:id/button2) and "YES" (id: android:id/button1) options.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), longClick, NULL): Long click on the back button to trigger a "Save changes?" dialog. The dialog contains a message "Save changes?" and two buttons: "NO" (id: android:id/button2) and "YES" (id: android:id/button1).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/action_note_colour, (544, 72), click, NULL): Click to open the note color selection dialog. A new dialog appears with title "Change note colour" and a grid of color options to choose from.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/action_note_colour, (592.0, 120.0), longClick, NULL): Long click to open color selection options for the note. No new page or dialog appears, suggesting the color options might be presented inline or through a subtle UI change not reflected in the provided JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (640, 72), click, NULL): Click on "More options" to open a menu with additional settings. The new menu includes options for "Note font size" and "Hide note body in list".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (680.0, 120.0), long_click, NULL): Long click on the "More options" button to open additional options menu. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, suggesting the menu might appear as an overlay on the current page.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleEdit, (0, 176), click, "Title"): Click to focus on the title input field. No new page or widgets appear, as the action only changes the focus to the title input field.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleEdit, (360.0, 226.0), longClick, "Title"): Long click on the title edit field to open the text selection menu. The page remains the same after this action, with no new widgets appearing.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyEdit, (0, 292), click, "*-_#!:>()"): Click to edit the note content. No new page or widgets appear, as the interaction only focuses the text input field for editing.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyEdit, (360.0, 316.5), long_click, "*-_#!:>()"): Long click on the note body to open a context menu with options for "粘贴" (Paste), "全选" (Select All), and "选择" (Select).

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have already executed the first two steps of the source test case (creating a new note and inputting special characters). Now, we need to proceed with verifying the note title and returning to the previous screen. Here's the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL):Click the back button to navigate back and trigger the "Save changes?" dialog
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (), matches, "Save changes?"):Verify that the "Save changes?" dialog appears
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (), click, NULL):Click "YES" to save the changes and return to the previous screen
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleEdit, (), matches, "*-_#!:>()[]"):Verify that the note title matches the expected text
~~~

Explanation:
1. We click the back button to navigate back, which should trigger the "Save changes?" dialog.
2. We assert that the "Save changes?" dialog appears to ensure the expected behavior.
3. We click "YES" to save the changes and return to the previous screen.
4. Finally, we verify that the note title matches the expected text, which includes all the special characters we input.

This step combines the navigation back and the assertion of the note title from the source test case, adapting to the specific flow of the target application which includes a save confirmation dialog.
Based on the provided input, I'll convert the actions into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the code wrapped in triple backticks:

```
d.click(0, 64)

assert d(resourceId="android:id/message").get_text() == "Save changes?"

d(resourceId="android:id/button1").click()

assert d(resourceId="com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleEdit").get_text() == "*-_#!:>()"
```

This code follows the given requirements and uses coordinates where available. For assertions and clicks where IDs are provided, it uses the resourceId attribute. The code is designed to work with the device variable 'd' as specified in the input.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated the core functionality of creating a new note and inputting special characters. However, we haven't yet verified the note title on the main list view. Let's proceed with the next step to complete the test case migration.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL):Click the back button to return to the main notes list
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView, (), matches, "*-_#!:>()[]"):Verify that the note title in the list view matches the expected text
DONE
~~~

This response completes the test case migration by:

1. Navigating back to the main notes list view.
2. Verifying that the newly created note appears in the list with the correct title.

The DONE statement indicates that we have successfully migrated all steps of the source test case to the target app. We have covered the creation of a new note, input of special characters, saving the note, and verifying its presence in the main list view. The migration has adapted to the differences in the target app's UI and functionality while maintaining the core testing objectives of the original test case.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(0, 64)
assert d(resourceId="com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView").get_text().strip() == "*-_#!:>()"
···

Note: In the assertion, I've used the `resourceId` to locate the TextView element since it's provided and unique. The `matches` operation is implemented as an exact match (==) for the given text. If a more flexible matching is required (e.g., using regular expressions), additional code would be needed.
