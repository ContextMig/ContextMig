#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with creating a new note, and the current page of the target app shows an empty state with options to create a new note or folder. Let's proceed with the first step of creating a new note.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, me.writeily:id/fab_expand_menu_button, (540, 1428), click, NULL): Click to expand the floating action menu to reveal the option for creating a new note.
~~~

This action corresponds to the first step in the source test case, where we initiate the process of creating a new note. In the target app, we need to first expand the floating action menu to access the create note option.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(540, 1428)
···

This code uses the coordinates (540, 1428) to perform a click action on the ImageButton with the id "me.writeily:id/fab_expand_menu_button". The coordinates are preferred as per the requirements, and they provide a precise location for the click operation.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step of the test case migration. The source test case starts with creating a new note, and the executed action sequence shows that the floating action menu has been expanded. The next logical step would be to create a new note.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, me.writeily:id/create_note, (540, 1116), click, NULL): Click to create a new note
~~~

This action corresponds to step 1 of the source test case, where a new note is initiated. In the target app, we're using the specific "create_note" button that becomes visible after expanding the floating action menu. This action should navigate to the note editing page, where we can proceed with entering the title and content in subsequent steps.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(540, 1116)
···

I've used the coordinates (540, 1116) to perform the click action, as per the recommendation to prefer using coordinates when they are precise. This code will click on the specified location to create a new note.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL): Click to go back to the previous page, which is the main page with a search button (id: me.writeily:id/search_button), an empty folder hint (id: me.writeily:id/empty_hint), and a floating action button (id: me.writeily:id/fab_expand_menu_button).
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (56.0, 120.0), click, NULL): Click on the back button to return to the previous level. This action navigates back to the main page with the "Writeily Pro" header, search button, and create note/folder options.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we can see that the test case migration has progressed to the point where a new note has been created. The next step in the source test case is to enter the title "to-do" in the note title field. Let's proceed with this step using the available intentions on the current page:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), input, "to-do"): Enter the title "to-do" in the note title field.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 in the source test case. We're using the EditText element with the id "me.writeily:id/edit_note_title" to input the title "to-do". This matches the functionality of entering a title for the new note, as described in the source test case.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code to perform the specified action:

```
d.click(144, 64)
d.send_keys("to-do")
```

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (144, 64) where the EditText field is located, and then inputs the text "to-do" into that field.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL): Click to navigate back to the main page, which contains a list of notes including "to-do", a search button with id "me.writeily:id/search_button", and a floating action button with id "me.writeily:id/fab_expand_menu_button".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (56.0, 120.0), click, NULL): Long press on the "转到上一层级" (back) button to navigate to the main page. The next page shows a list of notes with a "Files" section, a note titled "to-do", and a floating action button with id "me.writeily:id/fab_expand_menu_button".
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), click, "to-do"): Click to edit the note title. No new page or widgets appear after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (336.0, 122.0), long_click, "to-do"): Long click on the note title to open a context menu with options for paste, select all, and select text.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (528, 72), click, NULL): Click to open the share options for the current note. The share dialog or menu should appear, but no specific elements are visible in the provided Next Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (576.0, 120.0), longClick, NULL): Long click to open share options. No new page appears, but a share menu or dialog with sharing options likely pops up.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_preview, (672.0, 120.0), long_click, NULL): Long-click on the preview button to potentially access additional preview options or settings. The action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the JSON structure remains largely unchanged.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 180), click, NULL): Click to focus on the note content area for editing. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger new widgets, but allows the user to input text in the note content area.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (360.0, 582.5), long_click, NULL): Long click on the note content area to open a context menu, which includes a "Paste" option with id "android:id/floating_toolbar_menu_item_text".

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I will continue the test case migration. Here's the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 180), input, "Go shopping"): Enter the content "Go shopping" in the note content field.
~~~

Explanation:
1. We have already completed steps 1 and 2 of the source test case (creating a new note and entering the title "to-do").
2. The next step in the source test case is to enter the content "Go shopping" in the note content field.
3. From the current page's intent description, we can see that there is an EditText with id "me.writeily:id/note_content" which corresponds to the note content area.
4. Therefore, we can use this EditText to input the content "Go shopping", which matches step 3 of the source test case.

This action should allow us to enter the note content, just as in the original test case. After this action is executed, we will be ready to proceed with the next step of the test case migration.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(0, 180)
d.send_keys("Go shopping")
···

This code does the following:
1. Clicks on the coordinates (0, 180) where the EditText field is located.
2. Inputs the text "Go shopping" into the field.

I've used the coordinates as specified in the input, which is the preferred method according to the requirements. The device variable name 'd' is used as provided in the input.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I can determine that we are currently at step 4 of the source test case, which involves returning from the note editor to the main screen. Let's proceed with this step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL): Click the back button to return to the main notes list.
~~~

This action corresponds to the "RETURN" step in the source test case. By clicking the back button, we are navigating back from the note editor to the main screen, which should display the list of notes.

After this action, we should be able to proceed to step 5 of the source test case, which involves verifying the presence of the newly created note in the list.
Based on the given action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(0, 64)
···

This code simply clicks on the coordinates (0, 64) which corresponds to the back button as described in the action. Since the coordinates are provided and are precise, we use them directly in the `click()` method of the UIAutomator2 device object `d`.

Explanation:
1. We have successfully completed all the steps from the source test case:
   - Created a new note (Steps 1-2 in the source)
   - Entered the title "to-do" (Step 2)
   - Entered the content "Go shopping" (Step 3)
   - Returned to the main screen (Step 4)

2. The final step in the source test case is to verify the presence of the newly created note with the title "to-do" in the list of notes.

3. In the current page's intent description, we can see that there is a TextView with the id "me.writeily:id/note_title" and the text "to-do" at coordinates (160, 278).

4. Therefore, we can assert the presence of this TextView to verify that the note with the title "to-do" is visible in the list of notes.

5. After this assertion, we have completed all steps of the source test case, so we can conclude with "DONE".

This completes the migration of the test case from the source application to the target application, matching all the required steps and verifying the final result.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given assertion:

···
assert d(resourceId="me.writeily:id/note_title", text="to-do").exists()
···

I've used the resourceId and text attributes to locate the element, as these provide a more reliable way to find the specific note title compared to using coordinates. The `exists()` method is used to verify that the element is present on the screen, which aligns with the assertion's purpose of verifying that a note with the title "to-do" is visible in the list of notes.
