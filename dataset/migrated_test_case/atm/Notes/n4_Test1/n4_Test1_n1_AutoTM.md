#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we can proceed with the next step of the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. The source test case's first step was to click on an empty state linear layout to create a new note.
2. In the target app, we have already successfully executed an action to create a new note by clicking on an "add" action button.
3. The current page's intentions show that we are now on a note editing page with fields for title and body.

Given this, we can move on to the next step of the source test case, which is entering the title "to-do" in the note title field. Here's the appropriate action for the target app:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.iliakplv.notes:id/note_title, (16, 176), input, "to-do"):Enter the title "to-do" in the note title field
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 of the source test case. We're using the EditText element with the ID "com.iliakplv.notes:id/note_title" to input the title "to-do". The coordinates (16, 176) are used from the provided intentions, which indicate the location of the title input field.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(16, 176)
d.send_keys("to-do")
···

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (16, 176) where the EditText for the note title is located, and then sends the keys "to-do" to input the title.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll continue with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've successfully created a new note by clicking the add button.
2. We've entered the title "to-do" in the note title field.

The next step in our source test case is to enter the content "Go shopping" in the note content field. Let's proceed with this step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.iliakplv.notes:id/note_body, (16, 273), input, "Go shopping"):Enter the content "Go shopping" in the note body field
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in our source test case. We're using the EditText widget with the id "com.iliakplv.notes:id/note_body" to input the content "Go shopping". This matches both functionally and in terms of widget type with our source test case.
Based on the provided information and requirements, I'll convert the given action into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the code:

···
d.click(16, 273)
d.send_keys("Go shopping")
···

This code does the following:
1. Clicks on the specified coordinates (16, 273) which correspond to the EditText field for the note body.
2. Sends the keys "Go shopping" to input the content into the note body field.

I've used the coordinate-based approach as per your preference, and followed the instruction to use d.click() followed by d.send_keys() for text input.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I can determine that we have successfully completed the first four steps of the source test case. Let's proceed with the next step, which is to verify the presence of the newly created note in the list. Here's the appropriate action:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.iliakplv.notes:id/title, (28, 180), matches, "to-do"):Verify that a note with the title "to-do" is visible in the list of notes
~~~

This assertion checks if the note with the title "to-do" is present in the list, which corresponds to step 5 of the source test case. If this assertion passes, we have successfully migrated all steps of the source test case to the target app.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given assertion:

```
assert d(resourceId="com.iliakplv.notes:id/title", text="to-do").exists()
```

This code checks if a TextView with the resource ID "com.iliakplv.notes:id/title" and the text "to-do" exists on the screen. This assertion verifies that a note with the title "to-do" is visible in the list of notes.

Note that I've used the resource ID and text attributes instead of coordinates, as they provide a more robust way to identify the element, especially if the layout might change slightly across different device sizes or orientations. However, if you strictly prefer using coordinates, the code would be:

```
assert d(text="to-do").exists() and d(text="to-do").bounds()[0] == 28 and d(text="to-do").bounds()[1] == 180
```

This checks if an element with the text "to-do" exists and is located at the specified coordinates (28, 180).

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated the entire test case from the source application to the target application. Let's review the steps:

1. We created a new note by clicking the add button.
2. We entered the title "to-do" in the note title field.
3. We entered the content "Go shopping" in the note body field.
4. We saved the note and returned to the main notes list.
5. We verified that a note with the title "to-do" is visible in the list of notes.

These steps correspond directly to the steps in the source test case semantics. All the necessary actions have been performed and verified. Therefore, we can conclude that the test case migration is complete.

Here's the response indicating the completion of the test case migration:

~~~
DONE
~~~

This response signifies that we have successfully matched all steps of the source test case to actions in the target application, and the migration process is complete.
I understand that you want me to convert Android test semantic descriptions into UIAutomator2 code in Python. However, you haven't provided any specific actions to convert in your last message. You only mentioned "DONE" under the Actions section.

If you have any specific actions you'd like me to convert, please provide them in the format you described earlier:

ACTION (element, id, coordinates, action, value):purpose

or

ASSERT (element, id, coordinates, oracle):purpose

Once you provide these actions, I'll be happy to convert them into UIAutomator2 code for you, using the device variable name 'd' as specified.
