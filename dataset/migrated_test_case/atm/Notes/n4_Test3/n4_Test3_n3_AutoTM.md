#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with a long-click action on a note in the list view. Let's try to find a similar action in the target app that matches this functionality.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, me.writeily:id/notes_listview, (360.0, 404.0), long_click, NULL): Long click on the list view to open a context menu for file/folder operations.
~~~

This action corresponds to the first step in the source test case, where we long-click on a note to open the context menu. The target app seems to have a similar functionality, so we'll use this action to start our test case migration.
Based on the provided information, I'll convert the action into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the code wrapped in triple backticks:

```
d.long_click(360.0, 404.0, 1)
```

This code performs a long click operation at the specified coordinates (360.0, 404.0) for 1 second, which should open the context menu for file/folder operations as described in the action.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. The source test case involves setting a reminder for a note, but the current state of the target app shows we're at the main screen with a list of notes/folders. We need to open the context menu for a note to proceed.

Given that we've already performed a long-click on the list view, which should have opened a context menu, the next step would be to select the "Set Reminder" option from this menu. However, the current page's intentions don't explicitly show a "Set Reminder" option. We'll need to look for the closest matching action or explore other options.

Here's the next step in the migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (160, 278), click, "to-do"): Click on the "to-do" note title to open the note for editing.
~~~

Explanation:
1. We're selecting a specific note ("to-do") to work with, as we need to set a reminder for an existing note.
2. Opening the note for editing is a logical step before setting a reminder, as the reminder functionality might be accessible from the note editing screen.
3. This action aligns with the source test case's intention of working with a specific note, even though we're not directly setting a reminder yet.

Note that this step doesn't directly correspond to any single step in the source test case. Instead, it's an intermediary step necessary in the target app to reach the point where we can set a reminder. We'll need to explore the note editing screen in the next iteration to find options for setting a reminder.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(160, 278)
···

This code uses the coordinates (160, 278) to click on the "to-do" note title, which should open the note for editing. As per the requirements, using coordinates is preferred when they are provided, so we've used the exact coordinates given in the action description.

#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (32, 93), click, "Writeily Pro"): Click on the "Writeily Pro" title to navigate to the "to-do list" folder. The page displays a breadcrumb trail "Writeily > to-do list" with id "me.writeily:id/breadcrumbs" and shows an empty folder message with id "me.writeily:id/empty_hint".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (134.0, 120.0), longClick, "Writeily Pro"): Long click on the "Writeily Pro" title to possibly open additional options or menu. The action does not navigate to a new page or show new widgets.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/breadcrumbs, (360.0, 224.0), longclick, "Writeily > to-do list"): Long click on the breadcrumb to potentially navigate back or access folder options. No new page or dialog appears after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/empty_hint, (0, 272), click, "空文件夹"): Click on the empty folder hint. No change occurs as the folder remains empty, and no new elements are added to the page.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/empty_hint, (360.0, 936.0), longClick, "空文件夹"): Long click on the empty folder hint. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes in the UI.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, me.writeily:id/fab_expand_menu_button, (540, 1428), click, NULL): Click to expand the menu, revealing options to create a new note (id: me.writeily:id/create_note) and create a new folder (id: me.writeily:id/create_folder).

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with a long-click action on a note in the list view, which has been successfully executed in the target app. However, the next action in the target app (clicking on "to-do" note) doesn't directly correspond to the next step in the source test case.

Let's proceed with the next logical step based on the source test case and the current page's intentions:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, me.writeily:id/fab_expand_menu_button, (540, 1428), click, NULL): Click to expand the menu to reveal options for creating a new note or folder
~~~

Explanation:
1. In the source test case, after long-clicking a note, the next step is to select an option from the context menu (presumably "Set Reminder").
2. In the target app, we don't see a direct "Set Reminder" option. However, we can see that there's a floating action button that expands to show more options.
3. By clicking this button, we might reveal more options that could include something similar to setting a reminder or editing the note.
4. This action aligns with the goal of accessing additional functionality for the note, which is in line with the source test case's intention of setting a reminder.

If this action is successful, we'll be able to see what options are available and determine the next best step to match the source test case's functionality.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d.click(540, 1428)
```

This code uses the coordinate-based click operation as specified in the requirements. It clicks on the ImageButton at the coordinates (540, 1428) to expand the menu and reveal options for creating a new note or folder.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently at the step of setting a reminder for a note in the target application. Let's proceed with the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, me.writeily:id/create_note, (540, 1116), click, NULL): Click to create a new note to set a reminder for it.
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already long-clicked on a note in the list view (step 1 of the source test case).
2. Instead of directly setting a reminder, the target app seems to require creating a new note first.
3. We're using the expanded menu's "create_note" button to create a new note, which aligns with the intention of setting up a reminder for a note.
4. This action will open the note editing page, where we can proceed with setting up the reminder in subsequent steps.

Note that this step doesn't directly correspond to a single step in the source test case. We're adapting the test case to the target app's workflow, which appears to require creating a new note before setting a reminder.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(540, 1116)
···

This code uses the coordinates (540, 1116) to click on the ImageButton for creating a new note. As per the requirements, using coordinates is preferred when they are precise, which is the case here. The action is a simple click, so we use the `click()` method on the device object `d`.

#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL): Click to navigate back to the previous page, which is the "to-do list" folder page. The next page contains a search button with id "me.writeily:id/search_button" and an empty folder hint with id "me.writeily:id/empty_hint".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (56.0, 120.0), click, NULL): Click to return to the previous folder level. The next page shows the "Writeily > to-do list" folder view with an empty folder hint and a floating action button for creating new notes or folders.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), click, "标题"): Click to focus on the title input field for editing the note's title. No new page appears, but the keyboard may be displayed for text input.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (336.0, 122.0), longClick, "标题"): Long click on the title field to open a context menu with a "Paste" option at (116, 196).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (528, 72), click, NULL): Click to open the share menu. The share menu appears with options to share the note content through various apps or services.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (576.0, 120.0), longClick, NULL): Long click on the share button to potentially open additional sharing options. No new page appears, but the action might trigger a context menu or additional sharing functionality.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_preview, (624, 72), click, NULL): Click to preview the note content. The page transitions to a preview mode with a WebView (id: "") displaying the formatted note content and an edit button (id: "me.writeily:id/action_edit") replacing the preview button.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_preview, (672.0, 120.0), longClick, NULL): Long click on the preview button to toggle preview mode. No new page or dialog appears, but the preview functionality may be activated or deactivated.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 180), click, NULL): Click to focus on the note content area for editing. No new page or widgets appear after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (360.0, 582.5), longClick, NULL): Long click on the note content area to open a context menu with a "Paste" option (id: "", text: "粘贴").

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided information, we are currently at the step of creating a new note in the target application. This corresponds to the beginning of the source test case, where we need to set a reminder for a note. Let's proceed with the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), click, NULL):Click to focus on the title input field for editing the note's title
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), input, "Reminder Test"):Input a title for the new note
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 180), click, NULL):Click to focus on the note content area for editing
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 180), input, "This is a test note for setting a reminder"):Input content for the new note
~~~

Explanation:
1. We first click on the title input field to focus on it.
2. Then we input a title for the new note, "Reminder Test".
3. Next, we click on the note content area to focus on it.
4. Finally, we input some content for the note.

These actions set up a new note that we can use for setting a reminder, which aligns with the first step of the source test case. The next step would be to set up the reminder for this newly created note.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the provided actions:

···
d.click(144, 64)
d.send_keys("Reminder Test")
d.click(0, 180)
d.send_keys("This is a test note for setting a reminder")
···

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the title input field
2. Inputs the title "Reminder Test"
3. Clicks on the note content area
4. Inputs the content "This is a test note for setting a reminder"

Note that I've used the coordinates provided in the actions, as per your instruction to prefer using coordinates when they are precise.

#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL): Click the back button to return to the previous page, which displays a list of notes. The new page shows a ListView with id "me.writeily:id/notes_listview" containing the "Reminder Test" note.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (56.0, 120.0), longClick, NULL): Long press on the "Go back" button to enter selection mode. The next page shows a selection toolbar with options to move, delete, and rename the selected item. The selected item is "Reminder Test" with 1 item selected as indicated by the subtitle "1 项已选择".
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), click, "Reminder Test"): Click to edit the note title. No new page or dialog appears, but the keyboard may be activated for text input.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (336.0, 122.0), long_click, "Reminder Test"): Long click on the note title to open the text selection menu. The menu appears with options like "翻译" (Translate), "剪切" (Cut), "复制" (Copy), "粘贴" (Paste), and "分享" (Share).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (528, 72), click, NULL): Click to open the share options for the current note. The next page is likely a system share dialog or menu, which is not captured in the provided Next Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (576.0, 120.0), long_click, NULL): Long press the share button to open sharing options. No new page appears, but a sharing menu or dialog may have been triggered, though not visible in the provided JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_preview, (624, 72), click, NULL): Click to preview the note content. The page changes to a preview mode with a WebView displaying the note text and an "Edit" button (id: me.writeily:id/action_edit) replacing the "Preview" button.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_preview, (672.0, 120.0), longClick, NULL): Long-click on the preview button to potentially access additional options related to previewing the note. No new page or dialog appears, suggesting the long-click action might not have a specific functionality in this context.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 180), click, "This is a test note for setting a reminder"): Click to edit the note content. The action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, but allows the user to modify the existing note text.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (360.0, 582.5), long_click, "This is a test note for setting a reminder"): Long click on the note content to open a context menu with options for "Paste", "Select All", and "Select".

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully created a new note titled "Reminder Test" with the content "This is a test note for setting a reminder". The next step in the migration process should be to set a reminder for this note. However, the current page's intentions don't show a direct option for setting a reminder. Let's try to find a way to access the reminder settings.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (528, 72), click, NULL):Click on the share button to see if it opens a menu with more options, including setting a reminder
~~~
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(528, 72)
···

This code uses the coordinates (528, 72) to click on the share button, as specified in the action description. Using coordinates is the preferred method according to the requirements, and it's also the most precise way to interact with the UI element in this case.
