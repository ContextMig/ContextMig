#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with a long-click action on the first note in the list view. Let's find a corresponding action in the target application that matches this functionality.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, com.iliakplv.notes:id/notes_list, (360, 884), longClick, NULL): Long click on the notes list to open a context menu with options for Labels, Share, Info, Delete, and Cancel for the selected note "to-do list".
~~~

This action corresponds to the first step in the source test case. It performs a long-click on a note in the list, which should open a context menu with various options. This matches the functionality we're looking for in the first step of the source test case.
Based on the provided information, I'll convert the action into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the code:

···
d.long_click(360, 884, 1)
···

This code performs a long click operation at the coordinates (360, 884) on the notes list. The '1' at the end of the long_click method specifies the duration of the long press in seconds.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (82, 550), click, "to-do list"): Click on the title of the pop-up menu. This action does not navigate to a new page or change the current menu, as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (360.0, 579.5), long_click, "to-do list"): Long click on the note title. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger new widgets, as the current and next page JSONs are nearly identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (50, 648), click, "Labels"): Click on the "Labels" option to open the labels management page for the selected note. The page remains unchanged after this action, indicating that the labels functionality might be accessed through a different interface or not fully implemented in the current version.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (360.0, 696.0), longClick, "Labels"): Open the labels selection dialog for the note "to-do list". The dialog displays checkboxes for selecting labels such as "(grey)" and "(green)", with OK and Cancel buttons.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (360.0, 794.0), longClick, "Share"): Long press on the "Share" option in the context menu. This action does not navigate to a new page, but may trigger a system share dialog or other sharing functionality for the selected note.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (360.0, 892.0), long_click, "Info"): Long click on "Info" option to display note information. A dialog appears showing creation date and a "Close" button with id "android:id/button2".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (360.0, 990.0), long_click, "Delete"): Long click on the "Delete" option to open a confirmation dialog for deleting the note. The new dialog has a "Yes" button with id "android:id/button1" and a "No" button with id "android:id/button2".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (50, 1040), click, "Cancel"): Click to cancel the current operation and return to the main page with the list of notes. The page after clicking this button shows the notes list with items having id "com.iliakplv.notes:id/title" and text "to-do list".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (360.0, 1094.0), click, "Cancel"): Cancel the current operation and return to the main note list page, which contains a ListView with id "com.iliakplv.notes:id/notes_list" displaying multiple "to-do list" items.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case has been executed successfully in the target application. Let's proceed with the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (360.0, 696.0), longClick, "Labels"): Open the labels selection dialog for the note "to-do list"
~~~

Explanation:
1. In the source test case, after long-clicking on a note, the next action is to click on an item in the context menu (presumably the "Set Reminder" option).
2. In the target application, we don't see a direct "Set Reminder" option. However, we have a "Labels" option which could potentially be used to categorize or mark notes, which might serve a similar purpose to reminders in this app.
3. I've chosen to long-click on the "Labels" option as it seems to open a dialog with checkboxes, which could be used to set or modify labels (potentially serving as a form of reminder or categorization).
4. This action aligns with the general flow of the source test case (interacting with note properties after selecting a note) while adapting to the available options in the target application.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.long_click(360.0, 696.0, 1)
···

This code performs a long click action at the specified coordinates (360.0, 696.0) for 1 second, which should open the labels selection dialog for the note "to-do list". I've used the coordinates as they are precise and available, which is the preferred method according to the requirements.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the step of selecting labels for a note in the target application. This corresponds to the first step in the source test case, where a long click was performed to open a context menu. In the target app, we've already performed the long click and selected the "Labels" option. Now, we need to proceed with selecting a label for the note. Let's choose an appropriate action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.CheckBox, com.iliakplv.notes:id/checkbox, (74, 746), click, NULL):Click to select the "(grey)" label for the "to-do list"
~~~

This action selects a label for the note, which is similar in purpose to setting a reminder in the source test case. Although it's not exactly the same functionality, it's the closest match available based on the current page's intentions. After selecting the label, we should confirm the selection.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(74, 746)
···

This code uses the coordinates (74, 746) to perform a click action on the CheckBox element. The coordinates are preferred as per the requirements, and they provide a precise location for the interaction.

The page after this action shows a list of notes with titles "to-do list", indicating that the labels have been applied and the user is returned to the main note list view.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently in the process of setting labels for a note, which corresponds to step 2 in the source test case where a context menu option is selected. However, in the target app, this process involves selecting labels from a dialog. Let's proceed with confirming the label selection:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (361, 942), click, "OK"):Click the OK button to confirm the label selection for the to-do list
ASSERT (android.widget.ListView, com.iliakplv.notes:id/notes_list, (360, 884), isDisplayed):Verify that the main notes list is displayed after label selection
~~~

This action confirms the label selection and returns to the main notes list, which aligns with the intention of the source test case to modify a note's properties. The assertion ensures that we've returned to the main list view, preparing us for the next steps in the test case.
Based on the provided information and requirements, I'll convert the given actions into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the conversion:

```
d.click(361, 942)
assert d(resourceId="com.iliakplv.notes:id/notes_list").exists()
```

This code does the following:

1. Clicks the OK button at the coordinates (361, 942) to confirm the label selection for the to-do list.
2. Verifies that the main notes list is displayed after label selection by checking if the ListView with the specified resource ID exists.

I've used the coordinates for the click action as they were provided and precise. For the assertion, I've used the resource ID as it's unique and non-empty. The device variable name 'd' has been used as specified in the input.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have completed the labeling process for a note in the target application. Now, let's proceed with the next step in the source test case, which involves setting a reminder for the note. Here's the next action to take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, com.iliakplv.notes:id/notes_list, (360.0, 884.0), long_click, NULL):Long-click on the notes list to open the context menu for the "to-do list" note
~~~

This action corresponds to step 1 in the source test case, where we need to long-click on a note to open the context menu. We're reusing this action because we need to access the context menu again to set the reminder.

The reason for this approach is that the target application seems to have a different workflow for setting reminders compared to the source application. In the source app, the reminder option was directly available in the context menu, but we haven't seen such an option in the target app's context menu so far. Therefore, we need to explore the available options to find the most suitable path for setting a reminder.
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.long_click(360.0, 884.0, 1)
···

This code performs a long click operation at the specified coordinates (360.0, 884.0) on the notes list. The long click duration is set to 1 second, which is the standard duration for a long click in UIAutomator2.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (360.0, 579.5), long_click, "to-do list"): Long click on the note title. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger new widgets, as the current and next page JSONs are nearly identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (50, 648), click, "Labels"): Click on the "Labels" option to open the labels management page for the selected note. The page remains unchanged after this action, indicating that the labels functionality might be accessed through a different interface or not fully implemented in the current version.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (360.0, 696.0), longClick, "Labels"): Open the labels selection dialog for the note "to-do list". The dialog displays checkboxes for selecting labels such as "(grey)" and "(green)", with OK and Cancel buttons.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (360.0, 794.0), longClick, "Share"): Long press on the "Share" option in the context menu. This action does not navigate to a new page, but may trigger a system share dialog or other sharing functionality for the selected note.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (360.0, 892.0), long_click, "Info"): Long click on "Info" option to display note information. A dialog appears showing creation date and a "Close" button with id "android:id/button2".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (360.0, 990.0), long_click, "Delete"): Long click on the "Delete" option to open a confirmation dialog for deleting the note. The new dialog has a "Yes" button with id "android:id/button1" and a "No" button with id "android:id/button2".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (50, 1040), click, "Cancel"): Click to cancel the action and return to the main note list page, which contains a ListView with id "com.iliakplv.notes:id/notes_list" displaying multiple "to-do list" items.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (360.0, 1094.0), click, "Cancel"): Cancel the current operation and return to the main note list page, which contains a ListView with id "com.iliakplv.notes:id/notes_list" displaying multiple "to-do list" items.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll continue with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (360.0, 794.0), click, "Share"):Click on the "Share" option in the context menu to open the sharing functionality for the selected note
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already completed the first step of the source test case by long-clicking on a note in the list view.
2. The second step in the source test case involves clicking on the fourth item in the context menu, which was presumably the "Set Reminder" option.
3. However, in the target app, we don't see a direct "Set Reminder" option in the context menu. The closest functionality that might involve setting a reminder or modifying the note is the "Share" option.
4. Since we're focusing on functional similarity, we'll proceed with the "Share" option as it's an action that modifies or interacts with the note in some way.
5. We're using a regular click instead of a long click because the long click action didn't produce any visible change in the previous step.

This action aims to progress the test case by interacting with the note, even though it doesn't exactly match the "Set Reminder" functionality from the source app. After this action, we'll need to observe the result and adjust our strategy accordingly for the next steps.
Based on the provided action and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d.click(360, 794)
···

This code uses the coordinates provided (360.0, 794.0) to click on the "Share" option in the context menu. Since coordinates are available and precise, they are preferred over using the resourceId or text attribute as per the requirements.
