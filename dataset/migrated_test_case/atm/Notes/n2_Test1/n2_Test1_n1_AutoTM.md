#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with creating a new note, and the current page's intentions show that we have options to create a new note. Let's proceed with the first step of creating a new note.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.iliakplv.notes:id/action_add, (384, 64), click, NULL):Click to create a new note
~~~

This action corresponds to the first step in the source test case: "Click on the 'New note' button to create a new note". By clicking on the element with id "com.iliakplv.notes:id/action_add", we should be able to open the note creation interface.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(384, 64)
···

This code uses the coordinate-based click operation, which is the preferred method as per the requirements. The click action is performed at the coordinates (384, 64) to create a new note.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case has been successfully executed in the target app. Let's proceed with the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.iliakplv.notes:id/note_title, (16, 176), input, "Title1"):Enter "Title1" as the title of the new note
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 in the source test case. We're using the EditText field with the id "com.iliakplv.notes:id/note_title" to input the title "Title1". This matches the functionality of entering a title for the new note in the source test case.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code to perform the specified action:

```
d.click(16, 176)
d.send_keys("Title1")
```

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (16, 176) where the EditText for the note title is located, and then sends the keys "Title1" to input the title of the new note.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we can determine that we are currently on step 3 of the source test case. The first two steps have been successfully executed in the target app. Let's proceed with the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.iliakplv.notes:id/note_body, (16, 273), input, "Note1"):Enter "Note1" as the content of the new note
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 of the source test case, where we need to enter "Note1" as the content of the new note. The target app has a similar structure with an EditText field for the note body, so we can directly input the content there.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(16, 273)
d.send_keys("Note1")
···

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (16, 273) where the EditText is located, and then sends the text "Note1" to the input field.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I can see that we have successfully completed the first three steps of the source test case. We have created a new note, entered the title "Title1", and entered the content "Note1". Now, we need to proceed with the next step, which is to save and exit the note editing screen. Let's analyze the current page's intentions to find the most appropriate action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.iliakplv.notes:id/action_save_changes, (496, 64), click, NULL):Click to save changes and return to the main note list
~~~

This action corresponds to step 4 in the source test case, where we need to click on the back button to save and exit the note editing screen. Although the element types are different (ImageButton in the source vs TextView in the target), the functionality is the same, which is our priority for matching.
Based on the provided action and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d.click(496, 64)
```

This code uses the coordinates (496, 64) to perform a click action, which should save the changes and return to the main note list. As per the requirements, using coordinates is the preferred method when they are provided and precise.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I will proceed with the next step of the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We have successfully created a new note with the title "Title1" and content "Note1".
2. We have saved the changes and returned to the main note list.
3. The next step in the source test case is to verify that the newly created note appears in the list view with the correct title and content.

Given this, the next logical step would be to assert that the note with title "Title1" and content "Note1" is visible in the main note list. Here's the appropriate action:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.iliakplv.notes:id/title, (28, 180), matches, "Title1"):Verify that the title of the newly created note is displayed as "Title1" in the list view
~~~

This assertion checks if the title of the first note in the list matches "Title1", which corresponds to step 6 in the source test case. The coordinates (28, 180) are based on the information provided in the current page's intent description for the first note's title.
Based on the provided action and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the assertion:

···
assert d(resourceId="com.iliakplv.notes:id/title").get_text() == "Title1"
···

This code performs the following:

1. It uses the device variable name 'd' as specified.
2. It targets the TextView element with the resource ID "com.iliakplv.notes:id/title".
3. It retrieves the text of this element using the get_text() method.
4. It asserts that the retrieved text matches exactly "Title1".

Note: Although coordinates (28, 180) were provided, we've used the resource ID for this assertion as it's more reliable for identifying specific UI elements. If you absolutely prefer using coordinates, the code would look like this:

···
assert d(resourceId="com.iliakplv.notes:id/title", clickable=True).get_text() == "Title1"
···

This version still uses the resource ID to ensure we're targeting the correct element, but it adds the clickable=True attribute to narrow down the selection if there are multiple elements with the same ID.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided information, I can see that we have successfully migrated the first 5 steps of the source test case to the target application. Let's proceed with the next step:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.iliakplv.notes:id/subtitle, (28, 777), matches, "Note1"):Verify that the content of the newly created note is displayed as "Note1" in the list view
~~~

This assertion corresponds to step 7 in the source test case, where we verify that the content of the newly created note is displayed correctly in the list view. In the target application, this information appears to be shown in the subtitle field of the note item.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
assert d(resourceId="com.iliakplv.notes:id/subtitle").get_text() == "Note1"
···

Explanation:
- We're using the device variable name 'd' as specified.
- Since coordinates are provided (28, 777), we could have used them. However, the resourceId is unique and non-empty, which provides a more reliable way to identify the element.
- We're using the `get_text()` method to retrieve the text of the TextView and comparing it with the expected value "Note1".
- The assertion will pass if the text matches "Note1", otherwise it will fail.

This code verifies that the content of the newly created note is displayed as "Note1" in the list view, as requested in the assertion.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated all the steps from the source test case to the target application. Let's review the progress:

1. We created a new note by clicking the add button.
2. We entered "Title1" as the title of the new note.
3. We entered "Note1" as the content of the new note.
4. We saved the note by clicking the save changes button.
5. We verified that the title "Title1" is displayed in the list view.
6. We verified that the content "Note1" is displayed in the list view.

All these steps correspond to the steps in the source test case, and they have been executed successfully. The only difference is that in the target app, we used a "Save Changes" button instead of a back button and confirmation dialog. This is an example of how the same functionality can be implemented differently in different apps.

Since we have completed all the steps from the source test case and verified the results, we can conclude that the test case migration is complete. Therefore, I will respond with DONE:

~~~
DONE

Thank you for providing the device variable name and the information about the actions. I understand that the device variable name is 'd' and that there are no specific actions to convert at this moment since you've indicated "DONE" for the Actions section.

If you have any specific actions or assertions you'd like me to convert to UIAutomator2 code in Python, please provide them, and I'll be happy to assist you. Remember to follow the input format you've specified, including the element, id, coordinates, action, and value (if applicable) for each action or assertion.

When you're ready to provide the actions, I'll convert them into the appropriate UIAutomator2 code using the device variable 'd' and following the guidelines you've outlined.
