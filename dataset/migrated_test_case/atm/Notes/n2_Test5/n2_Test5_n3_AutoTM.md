#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to click on the search action menu item. Let's find the corresponding action in the target application.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, me.writeily:id/search_button, (544, 72), click, NULL): Click to open the search interface.
~~~

This action corresponds to the first step in the source test case, which is to open the search interface. The next step would be to input the search query, but we need to wait for the search interface to appear before proceeding.
Based on the provided information, I'll convert the action into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Since coordinates are available and are the preferred choice, I'll use them for the click operation.

···
d.click(544, 72)
···

This code will click on the search button at the specified coordinates (544, 72) to open the search interface.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I will proceed with the next step in migrating the test case. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. The source test case's first step is to open the search interface.
2. The executed action sequence shows that we have already clicked on the search button to open the search interface.
3. The current page's intentions show that the search input field is now visible and clickable.

Given this, we can proceed to the next step of the source test case, which is entering the search query "Title1" into the search text field. Here's the appropriate action for the target app:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/search_src_text, (96, 84), input, "Title1"): Enter the search query "Title1" into the search text field.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 of the source test case. We're using the search input field that became visible after clicking the search button in the previous step. The action type is "input" to enter the text "Title1" into the search field.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d.click(96, 84)
d.send_keys("Title1")
```

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (96, 84) where the search text field is located, and then sends the keys "Title1" to input the search query.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully completed the first two steps of the source test case. Let's proceed with the next step, which is to verify the search results. Here's the next action we should take:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/note_title, (160, 437), matches(allOf(isDisplayed(), withText("Title1")))):Verify that a TextView with the text "Title1" is displayed in the search results.
~~~

This assertion checks if the search results display a note with the title "Title1", which corresponds to step 3 in the source test case. We're using the note_title element from the current page's intentions, as it seems to be the most relevant element for this assertion.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
assert d(resourceId="me.writeily:id/note_title", text="Title1").exists()
···

This code checks if a TextView with the resource ID "me.writeily:id/note_title" and the text "Title1" exists on the screen. This assertion verifies that the note title "Title1" is displayed in the search results.

Note: While coordinates were provided (160, 437), I chose to use the resourceId and text attributes for this assertion as they provide a more reliable way to identify the specific element, especially when verifying text content. This approach is less likely to break due to slight UI changes or different device resolutions.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated the first three steps of the source test case. Let's proceed with the next step, which is to clear the search query. Here's the appropriate action for the target app:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, me.writeily:id/search_close_btn, (624, 72), click, NULL):Click on the clear query button to reset the search.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 4 in the source test case, which is to click on the clear query button. The target app has a similar functionality with a clear button (search_close_btn) that matches the purpose of resetting the search.

After executing this action, we should have completed all steps of the source test case. However, to ensure the search has been cleared, we might want to add an assertion. If you confirm that this action was successful and the search was indeed cleared, we can proceed to mark the test case migration as complete.
Based on the provided information, I'll convert the action into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the code wrapped in triple backticks:

```
d.click(624, 72)
```

This code uses the coordinates (624, 72) to click on the clear query button, as specified in the action description. The coordinate-based approach is preferred as per the requirements, and it's the most precise method to interact with the UI element in this case.

#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (32, 93), click, "Writeily Pro"): Click on the "Writeily Pro" title to potentially refresh the main page or return to the top of the note list. The page remains the same after this action, with no new elements appearing.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (32, 93), long_click, "Writeily Pro"): Long click on the "Writeily Pro" title to potentially trigger additional options or actions related to the app. However, the long click action does not appear to cause any visible changes in the UI based on the provided Next Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/search_src_text, (96, 84), click, "搜索笔记"): Click to focus on the search input field. The search functionality is activated, allowing the user to type and search for notes. The search close button with id "me.writeily:id/search_close_btn" becomes visible for clearing the search query.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/search_src_text, (96, 84), long_click, "搜索笔记"): Long click on the search input field to activate text selection or additional options. This action doesn't navigate to a new page or trigger new widgets, as the page content remains the same after the long click.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, me.writeily:id/search_close_btn, (624, 72), click, NULL): Clear the search query and return to the main note list view. The search bar is replaced with a search button (id: me.writeily:id/search_button) and an options button.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, me.writeily:id/search_close_btn, (624, 72), longClick, NULL): Long press on the clear search button to exit the search mode. The page returns to the main note list view with a search button (id: me.writeily:id/search_button) and more options button visible.
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, me.writeily:id/notes_listview, (0, 176), click, NULL): Click on the notes list to select a note. Clicking this control does not navigate to a new page, as the next page JSON shows the same structure and elements as the current page.
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, me.writeily:id/notes_listview, (0, 176), long_click, NULL): Long click on the notes list view to activate selection mode. This action does not navigate to a new page, but it may trigger the appearance of contextual action buttons for operations like delete, share, or move on the selected note items.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (0, 176), click, NULL): Click on the LinearLayout to open the Files section. This action does not navigate to a new page, but displays the list of files including "Title2" and "Title1" with their respective last modified dates.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (0, 176), longClick, NULL): Long click on the list view to activate selection mode for notes. This action does not navigate to a new page, but may highlight the selected item or show additional options for managing notes.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/notes_fragment_section_text, (30, 206), click, "Files"): Click on the "Files" section header. This action does not navigate to a new page or cause any visible changes in the UI elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/notes_fragment_section_text, (30, 206), long_click, "Files"): Long click on the "Files" section header. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes in the UI based on the provided JSON data.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (0, 246), click, NULL): Click to open the note titled "Title2". This action navigates to the note editing page for the selected note.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (0, 246), longClick, NULL): Long click on the note item to enter selection mode. A new action bar appears with options to move, delete, and rename the selected note. The action bar includes a "Complete" button with id "me.writeily:id/action_mode_close_button", a title "Select item" with id "me.writeily:id/action_bar_title", and a subtitle "1 item selected" with id "me.writeily:id/action_bar_subtitle".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/note_title, (160, 278), click, "Title2"): Click on the note titled "Title2" to open and edit it. The next page shows an editable note with title "Title2" (id: me.writeily:id/edit_note_title) and content (id: me.writeily:id/note_content), along with options to share (id: me.writeily:id/action_share) and preview (id: me.writeily:id/action_preview) the note.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/note_title, (160, 278), longClick, "Title2"): Long click on the note title to initiate selection mode. This action brings up a contextual action bar with options to move, delete, or rename the selected note. The action bar includes a "完成" (Done) button with id "me.writeily:id/action_mode_close_button", and action buttons for move "me.writeily:id/context_menu_move", delete "me.writeily:id/context_menu_delete", and rename (no specific id).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/note_extra, (160, 330), click, "最后修改：2024/8/27 05:56"): Click to open the note titled "Title2" for editing. The new page shows an editable note with title "Title2" (id: me.writeily:id/edit_note_title) and content area (id: me.writeily:id/note_content).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/note_extra, (160, 330), longClick, "最后修改：2024/8/27 05:56"): Long click on the note's modification date to open a context menu for the note. The new menu includes options to move (id: "me.writeily:id/context_menu_move"), delete (id: "me.writeily:id/context_menu_delete"), and rename (no id) the selected note.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, me.writeily:id/fab_expand_menu_button, (540, 813), click, NULL): Click to expand the floating action menu, revealing options to create a new note (id: me.writeily:id/create_note) and create a new folder (id: me.writeily:id/create_folder).
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, me.writeily:id/fab_expand_menu_button, (540, 813), longClick, NULL): Long click to expand the floating action menu, revealing options to create a new note (id: me.writeily:id/create_note) and create a new folder (id: me.writeily:id/create_folder).

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated the first four steps of the source test case to the target application. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've opened the search interface.
2. We've entered "Title1" into the search field.
3. We've verified that a TextView with "Title1" is displayed in the search results.
4. We've cleared the search query.

These actions correspond to all the steps in the source test case. Therefore, we can conclude that the test case migration is complete.

Here's the response in the required format:

~~~
DONE
~~~

This response indicates that we have successfully matched and migrated all steps of the source test case to the target application. The test case for the search functionality, including opening the search interface, entering a query, verifying results, and clearing the query, has been successfully implemented in the target app.
I understand that you've provided the device variable name as 'd', but you haven't given any actions to convert into UIAutomator2 code. The "DONE" at the end of your message suggests that there are no actions to process.

If you have any specific actions you'd like me to convert into UIAutomator2 code, please provide them in the format you described earlier:

ACTION (element, id, coordinates, action, value):purpose

or

ASSERT (element, id, coordinates, oracle):purpose

Once you provide these actions, I'll be happy to convert them into the appropriate UIAutomator2 code for you.
