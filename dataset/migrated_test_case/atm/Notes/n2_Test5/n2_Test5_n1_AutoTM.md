#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with opening the search interface, but the current page's intentions don't directly show a search option. However, there is an options menu that might contain the search functionality. Let's start by opening this menu:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (608, 64), click, NULL):Open the options menu to find the search functionality
~~~
Based on the given information and requirements, I'll convert the action into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the code:

···
d.click(608, 64)
···

This code clicks on the ImageButton located at coordinates (608, 64) to open the options menu for accessing the search functionality. I've used the coordinate-based approach as it's the preferred method according to the requirements, and precise coordinates were provided in the input.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (344, 379), click, "Settings"): Click on the "Settings" option to navigate to the settings page. The next page displays a settings menu with options including "Links in note" and a checkbox to enable/disable clickable links and phone numbers in note's text.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (344, 379), long_click, "Settings"): Long click on "Settings" option to open the Settings page. The new page contains a "Links in note" option with a checkbox (id: android:id/checkbox) to enable/disable clickable links in notes.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to open the search interface. Let's proceed with finding and activating the search functionality in the target app.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (344, 281), click, "Search"):Click on the "Search" option to open the search interface
~~~

This action attempts to click on the "Search" option in the menu, which should open the search interface. This corresponds to step 1 in the source test case where the search action menu item is clicked. We're choosing this action because it's the most functionally similar to the source test case's first step, even though the exact widget type is different (TextView instead of ActionMenuItemView).
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(344, 281)
···

I've used the coordinates (344, 281) as the primary method to perform the click action, as per the requirement to prefer using coordinates when they are precise. This code will click on the "Search" option to open the search interface.

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully opened the search interface. This aligns with the first step of the source test case. Now, let's proceed with the next step, which is to enter the search query.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, android:id/search_src_text, (115, 74), click, NULL):Click to focus on the search input field
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, android:id/search_src_text, (115, 74), input, "Title1"):Enter the search query "Title1" into the search text field
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 of the source test case. We first click on the search input field to focus it, and then input the search query "Title1". This should initiate the search functionality in the target app.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given actions:

···
d.click(115, 74)
d.send_keys("Title1")
···

This code first clicks on the search input field at the specified coordinates (115, 74) to focus on it, and then enters the search query "Title1" into the field using the `send_keys` method.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case semantics, it appears that we have successfully completed steps 1 and 2 of the source test case. We have opened the search interface and entered the search query "Title1". The next step in the source test case is to verify that a TextView with the text "Title1" is displayed and enabled in the search results.

Given the current page's intent description, we can see that there is a ListView with id "com.iliakplv.notes:id/notes_list" which likely contains the search results. We should assert that a note with the title "Title1" is visible in this list.

Here's the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.iliakplv.notes:id/title, (28, 180), matches(allOf(isDisplayed(), withText("Title1")))):Verify that a TextView with the text "Title1" is displayed in the search results
~~~

This assertion checks if a TextView with the specified id and text "Title1" is displayed in the search results, which corresponds to step 3 in the source test case. If this assertion passes, we can move on to the next step in the source test case, which is to clear the search query.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given assertion:

```
assert d(resourceId="com.iliakplv.notes:id/title", text="Title1").exists() and d(resourceId="com.iliakplv.notes:id/title", text="Title1").info['visibleBounds']['left'] == 28 and d(resourceId="com.iliakplv.notes:id/title", text="Title1").info['visibleBounds']['top'] == 180
```

This code checks for the existence of a TextView with the specified resource ID and text, and also verifies its position on the screen. The assertion will pass if all conditions are met.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information and the executed action sequence, it appears that we have successfully migrated the first three steps of the source test case. Let's proceed with the next step, which is to clear the search query. Here's the suggested action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, android:id/search_close_btn, (514, 64), click, NULL):Click on the clear query button to reset the search
~~~

This action corresponds to step 4 in the source test case, which is to click on the clear query button. The target app seems to have a similar functionality with the same element ID, so we can directly use it.

After this action, we should have completed all steps of the source test case. However, to ensure the test case is fully migrated, we need to verify that the search has been cleared. Let's add an assertion for this:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, android:id/search_close_btn, (514, 64), click, NULL):Click on the clear query button to reset the search
ASSERT (android.widget.EditText, android:id/search_src_text, (115, 74), withText("")):Verify that the search query has been cleared
DONE
~~~

This response includes the action to clear the search, an assertion to verify that the search field is empty after clearing, and the DONE statement to indicate that we have successfully migrated all steps of the source test case to the target app.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(514, 64)
d.click(514, 64)
assert d(resourceId="android:id/search_src_text").get_text() == ""
···

This code does the following:
1. Clicks on the clear query button twice at the coordinates (514, 64).
2. Verifies that the search query has been cleared by checking if the text in the search box is empty.

### Success
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (608, 64), click, NULL):Open the options menu to find the search functionality, Exec_Success

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (344, 281), click, "Search"):Click on the "Search" option to open the search interface, Exec_Success

ACTION (android.widget.EditText, android:id/search_src_text, (115, 74), click, NULL):Click to focus on the search input field, Exec_Success
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, android:id/search_src_text, (115, 74), input, "Title1"):Enter the search query "Title1" into the search text field, Exec_Success

ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.iliakplv.notes:id/title, (28, 180), matches(allOf(isDisplayed(), withText("Title1")))):Verify that a TextView with the text "Title1" is displayed in the search results, Exec_Success

ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, android:id/search_close_btn, (514, 64), click, NULL):Click on the clear query button to reset the search, Exec_Success
ASSERT (android.widget.EditText, android:id/search_src_text, (115, 74), withText("")):Verify that the search query has been cleared, Exec_Success
DONE
