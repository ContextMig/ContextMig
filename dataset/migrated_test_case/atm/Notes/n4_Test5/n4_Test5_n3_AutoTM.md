#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to create a new note. Let's match this step with the available actions in the target application.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, me.writeily:id/fab_expand_menu_button, (810, 1542), click, NULL): Click on the floating action button to open the menu for creating new items.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, me.writeily:id/create_note, (), click, NULL): Click on the "create_note" button to create a new note.
~~~

This sequence of actions should create a new note in the target application, which corresponds to the first step in the source test case. The floating action button is used to access the creation options, and then we specifically select the option to create a new note.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given actions:

```
d.click(810, 1542)
d(resourceId="me.writeily:id/create_note").click()
```

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the floating action button at coordinates (810, 1542) to open the menu for creating new items.
2. Clicks on the "create_note" button using its resource ID to create a new note.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, "", (0, 72), click, NULL): Click to return to the previous level. The page after clicking this control is the main page, which has a ListView with id "me.writeily:id/notes_listview" containing notes, and a floating action button with id "me.writeily:id/fab_expand_menu_button".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 72), longClick, NULL): Long press the back button to return to the previous page, which is the main page with a list of notes. The main page contains a ListView with id "me.writeily:id/notes_listview" and a floating action button with id "me.writeily:id/fab_expand_menu_button".
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (216, 72), click, "标题"): Click to focus on the note title field for editing. No new page or widgets appear as this action only activates the text input for the title.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (216, 72), longClick, "标题"): Long click on the note title field to select all text or open text editing options. No new page or dialog appears after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (792, 84), click, NULL): Click to open the share menu. The share menu is not visible in the provided Next Page JSON, suggesting it might be a system-level dialog or a temporary overlay not captured in the app's view hierarchy.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (792, 84), long_click, NULL): Long click on the share button to open sharing options. No new page appears, but a sharing menu or dialog with various sharing options is likely to be displayed.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_preview, (936, 84), click, NULL): Click to preview the note. The page changes to a preview mode with a WebView element for displaying the formatted note content and an "Edit" button (id: me.writeily:id/action_edit) replacing the "Preview" button.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_preview, (936, 84), longClick, NULL): Long click on the preview button to potentially access additional preview options or settings. No new page or dialog appears, as the current and next page JSONs are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 245), click, NULL): Click to focus and edit the note content. The page remains the same after clicking, allowing the user to input or modify text in the note content area.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 245), long_click, NULL): Long click on the note content area to potentially bring up text selection or editing options. No new page or widgets appear after this action.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (216, 72), click, NULL):Click to focus on the note title field for editing
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (216, 72), input, "CS100"):Enter the title "CS100" for the new note
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've successfully created a new note in the target app, which corresponds to step 1 in the source test case.
2. The next step in the source test case is to enter the title "CS100" for the new note.
3. In the target app, we need to first click on the title field to focus it, then input the title.
4. The intention list shows that the title field has the id "me.writeily:id/edit_note_title" and coordinates (216, 72).
5. We perform two actions: first clicking to focus, then inputting the title "CS100".

This step completes the migration of step 2 from the source test case to the target app.
I understand. Based on the provided actions and requirements, I'll convert them into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the corresponding code:

···
d.click(216, 72)
d.send_keys("CS100")
···

This code first clicks on the note title field using the provided coordinates (216, 72) to focus on it. Then, it uses the send_keys method to input the title "CS100" into the field.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 72), click, NULL): Click the back button to return to the previous page, which is the main notes list. The next page contains a ListView with id "me.writeily:id/notes_listview" showing multiple note entries, including one titled "CS100".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 72), longClick, NULL): Long click on the "Back" button to return to the previous screen, which appears to be the main notes list. The next page shows a list of notes including "note" and "CS100", with options to search and access more settings.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (216, 72), click, "CS100"): Click on the note title to edit it. The page remains the same after clicking, with the title field "CS100" now selected for editing.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (216, 72), long_click, "CS100"): Long press on the note title to open a context menu with options to cut, copy, share, and search the selected text.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (792, 84), click, NULL): Click to open the share menu. The action does not navigate to a new page, but likely opens a system share dialog or menu with options to share the note content.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (792, 84), longClick, NULL): Long click on the share button to open sharing options. The action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the page layout remains unchanged after the long click.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_preview, (936, 84), click, NULL): Click to preview the note content. The page transitions to a preview mode with a WebView component to display the formatted note, and the action button changes to "me.writeily:id/action_edit" for returning to edit mode.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_preview, (936, 84), longClick, NULL): Long click on the preview button to open additional options related to previewing the note content. No new page or widgets appear after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 245), click, NULL): Click on the note content area to start editing. This action does not navigate to a new page but allows the user to input text in the note content field.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 245), longClick, NULL): Long click on the note content area to activate text selection or editing options. No new page or dialog appears, as the action is performed on the same screen.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 245), click, NULL):Click on the note content area to start editing
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 245), input, "Session1"):Enter the content "Session1" for the new note
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already completed steps 1 and 2 of the source test case (creating a new note and entering the title "CS100").
2. The next step in the source test case is to enter the content "Session1" for the new note.
3. From the current page's intent description, we can see that there's an EditText widget with id "me.writeily:id/note_content" which corresponds to the note content area.
4. We first need to click on this area to focus it, and then input the content "Session1".

This action matches step 3 of the source test case, adapting it to the specific elements and IDs available in the target application.
Based on the provided actions, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

```
d.click(0, 245)
d.send_keys("Session1")
```

This code first clicks on the note content area using the provided coordinates (0, 245), and then inputs the text "Session1" into the active input field.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 72), click, NULL): Click on the back button to return to the previous page, which is the main notes list. The next page contains a ListView with id "me.writeily:id/notes_listview" showing the list of notes, including the recently edited "CS100" note.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (216, 72), click, "CS100"): Click to edit the note title. No new page or widgets appear as a result of this action.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (216, 72), longClick, "CS100"): Long click on the note title to open a context menu with options to cut, copy, share, and search the title text.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (792, 84), click, NULL): Click to share the current note. This action opens the system sharing options, allowing the user to share the note content through various available apps or services.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (792, 84), longClick, NULL): Long click on the share button to open sharing options. The page remains the same after this action, suggesting that a context menu or dialog for sharing options may appear overlaying the current page.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_preview, (936, 84), click, NULL): Click to preview the note content. The page transitions to a preview mode with a WebView displaying the formatted note content and an "Edit" button (id: me.writeily:id/action_edit) replacing the "Preview" button.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_preview, (936, 84), longClick, NULL): Long click on the preview button to display additional options or perform a specific action related to previewing the note content. No new page or dialog appears after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 245), click, "Session1"): Click to edit the note content. This action does not navigate to a new page, but allows the user to modify the text in the note content area.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 245), longClick, "Session1"): Long click on the note content to open a context menu with options to cut, copy, share, and search the selected text.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll continue with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 72), click, NULL):Click on the back button to return to the main notes list
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/note_title, (), isCompletelyDisplayed):Verify that the note title "CS100" is completely displayed in the main list
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/note_content, (), isCompletelyDisplayed):Verify that the note content "Session1" is completely displayed in the main list
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've completed steps 1-3 of the source test case (creating a new note and entering title and content).
2. The next step in the source test case is to return to the main notes list, which aligns with the first action in the current page's intent description.
3. After returning to the main list, we need to verify that the newly created note is displayed correctly, which corresponds to steps 5 and 6 in the source test case.
4. I've adapted the element IDs to match those provided in the current page's intent description, assuming that "me.writeily:id/note_title" and "me.writeily:id/note_content" are the correct IDs for the list items in the target app.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the given actions and assertions:

```
d.click(0, 72)

assert d(resourceId="me.writeily:id/note_title").exists()
assert d(resourceId="me.writeily:id/note_content").exists()
```

This code does the following:

1. Clicks on the back button at coordinates (0, 72) to return to the main notes list.
2. Asserts that the note title element with the resource ID "me.writeily:id/note_title" exists and is completely displayed.
3. Asserts that the note content element with the resource ID "me.writeily:id/note_content" exists and is completely displayed.

Note that UIAutomator2 doesn't have a direct method to check if an element is completely displayed. The `exists()` method is used as an approximation, assuming that if the element exists, it is likely completely displayed. For more precise visibility checks, you might need to use additional methods or custom functions.

ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, me.writeily:id/search_button, (816, 84), click, NULL): Click to open the search functionality
~~~

This action corresponds to step 7 in the source test case, where we click on the search icon to open the search functionality. The target app has a specific search button with the id "me.writeily:id/search_button", which we can use for this purpose.
I understand. Based on the provided information and requirements, I'll convert the given action into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the conversion:

```
d.click(816, 84)
```

This code uses the coordinate-based click method as it's the preferred choice when precise coordinates are available. The action is to click on the search button, which is represented by an ImageView with the ID "me.writeily:id/search_button" at coordinates (816, 84).

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully completed steps 1 through 7 of the source test case. The next step is to perform a search operation. Let's proceed with step 8:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/search_src_text, (144, 102), click, NULL):Click to focus on the search input field
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/search_src_text, (144, 102), input, "cs"):Enter "cs" into the search field to perform the search
~~~

This action corresponds to step 8 in the source test case: "Enter "cs" into the search field and perform the search." We're using the search input field identified in the current page's intent description to perform this action.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given actions:

```
d.click(144, 102)
d.send_keys("cs")
```

This code first clicks on the search input field at the specified coordinates (144, 102) to focus on it, and then enters the text "cs" into the field to perform the search.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully completed steps 1 through 8 of the source test case. The next step is to verify the search results. Let's proceed with the assertions:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/note_title, (), isDisplayed):Verify that the note title "CS100" is displayed in the search results
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/note_content, (), isDisplayed):Verify that the note content "Session1" is displayed in the search results
DONE
~~~

These assertions correspond to steps 9 and 10 of the source test case. We're verifying that both the title "CS100" and the content "Session1" are displayed in the search results after searching for "cs".

After these assertions, we have completed all steps of the source test case, so I've included the DONE statement to indicate that the migration is complete.
Based on the provided actions, I'll convert them into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the corresponding code:

···
assert d(resourceId="me.writeily:id/note_title").exists(), "Note title is not displayed"
assert d(resourceId="me.writeily:id/note_content").exists(), "Note content is not displayed"
···

Note: 
1. I've used the `exists()` method to check if the elements are displayed, as it's a common way to verify visibility in UIAutomator2.
2. The device variable name is set to 'd' as specified in the input.
3. Since specific coordinates weren't provided, I've used the resourceId to locate the elements.
4. I've added error messages to make it clear what's being asserted, which can be helpful for debugging.
