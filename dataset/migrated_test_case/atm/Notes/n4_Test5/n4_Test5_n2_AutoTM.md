#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to create a new note. Let's match this action with the available intentions on the current page.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/newNote, (795, 1515), click, NULL): Click to create a new note
~~~

This action corresponds to the first step in the source test case, which is clicking on the empty notes layout to create a new note. In the target app, we have a specific button for creating a new note, so we'll use that instead.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d.click(795, 1515)
```

This code will click on the coordinates (795, 1515) to create a new note, as specified in the action description. The coordinates are used as the preferred method of interaction, as per the requirements.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 72), click, NULL): Click to navigate back, prompting a dialog to save changes with options "NO" (id: android:id/button2) and "YES" (id: android:id/button1).
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 72), longClick, NULL): Long press on the back button to trigger a save changes dialog. The dialog contains a message "Save changes?" and two buttons: "NO" (id: android:id/button2) and "YES" (id: android:id/button1).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/action_note_colour, (816, 84), click, NULL): Opens a dialog to change the note color. The dialog includes a title "Change note colour" and a grid of color options represented by 9 clickable FrameLayout elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/action_note_colour, (816, 84), long_click, NULL): Long click to open note color options. No new page appears, but a color selection dialog or menu likely appears (not visible in the provided JSON).
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (960, 84), click, NULL): Open options menu. A popup menu appears with two options: "Note font size" and "Hide note body in list".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (960, 84), longClick, NULL): Open options menu. The menu displays two options: "Note font size" with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/title" and "Hide note body in list" with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/title".
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleEdit, (0, 240), click, "Title"): Click to edit the title of the note. This action does not navigate to a new page but allows the user to input text in the title field.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleEdit, (0, 240), longClick, "Title"): Long click on the title field to potentially trigger a context menu or selection options. No new page or dialog appears after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyEdit, (0, 414), click, "Note"): Click to focus on the note body input field. No new page appears, but the keyboard may be displayed to allow text input.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyEdit, (0, 414), longClick, "Note"): Long click on the note body to activate text selection or additional options. No new page or dialog appears, the interface remains unchanged after this action.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleEdit, (0, 240), input, "CS100"): Enter the title "CS100" for the new note.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 in the source test case, where we enter the title "CS100" for the new note. The target app seems to have a similar structure with a dedicated field for the note title, so we can directly input the title here.
Based on the given information, I'll convert the action into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the code:

```
d.click(0, 240)
d.send_keys("CS100")
```

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the EditText field at the coordinates (0, 240).
2. Inputs the text "CS100" into the field.

I've used the coordinates as specified in the input, which is the preferred method according to the requirements. The device variable name 'd' is used as provided in the input.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 72), click, NULL): Click the back button to navigate away from the note editing page, triggering a "Save changes?" dialog with "NO" (id: android:id/button2) and "YES" (id: android:id/button1) options.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 72), longClick, NULL): Long press on the back button to trigger a "Save changes?" dialog. The dialog contains a message "Save changes?" and two buttons: "NO" (id: android:id/button2) and "YES" (id: android:id/button1).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/action_note_colour, (816, 84), click, NULL): Opens a color selection dialog titled "Change note colour" with a 3x3 grid of clickable color options (FrameLayout elements) for changing the note's color.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/action_note_colour, (816, 84), longClick, NULL): Long click to open color selection options. The action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, suggesting the color selection might be handled through a separate UI component not captured in the JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (960, 84), click, NULL): Opens a menu with options "Note font size" and "Hide note body in list". The new menu has two clickable items with text "Note font size" and "Hide note body in list", both having id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/title".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (960, 84), longClick, NULL): Open options menu. The menu contains "Note font size" and "Hide note body in list" options.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleEdit, (0, 240), click, "CS100"): Click to edit the title of the note. The action doesn't navigate to a new page, but allows editing the title text which has been changed from "Title" to "CS100".
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleEdit, (0, 240), longClick, "CS100"): Long click on the title field to open text selection options. A new "Select All" button appears with text "全选" at coordinates (337, 144).
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyEdit, (0, 414), click, "Note"): Click to focus on the note body input field. No new page or widgets appear after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyEdit, (0, 414), longClick, "Note"): Long click on the note body to potentially bring up additional options or enable text selection. No new page or dialog appears after this action.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at step 3 of the source test case. We have successfully created a new note and entered the title "CS100". The next step is to enter the content "Session1" for the new note. Let's proceed with this step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyEdit, (0, 414), input, "Session1"): Enter the content "Session1" for the new note.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in the source test case. We're using the EditText field with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyEdit" to input the content "Session1". This matches the functionality described in the source test case, even though the exact element identifiers are different.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code for the given action:

···
d.click(0, 414)
d.send_keys("Session1")
···

This code first clicks on the EditText at the specified coordinates (0, 414) and then inputs the text "Session1" into the field.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 72), click, NULL): Click on the back button to return to the previous screen, which prompts a dialog asking "Save changes?" with "NO" (id: android:id/button2) and "YES" (id: android:id/button1) options.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 72), longClick, NULL): Long-press on the back button to trigger a "Save changes?" dialog, which includes "NO" (id: android:id/button2) and "YES" (id: android:id/button1) options.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/action_note_colour, (816, 84), click, NULL): Open color selection dialog to change note color. The dialog contains a title "Change note colour" and a grid of 9 clickable color options.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/action_note_colour, (816, 84), longClick, NULL): Long click on the note colour button to open the colour selection menu. No new page appears, but a colour selection dialog or menu is likely to pop up (not visible in the provided JSON).
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (960, 84), click, NULL): Opens a popup menu with options "Note font size" and "Hide note body in list". The popup menu includes two clickable LinearLayout elements, one for each option.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (960, 84), longClick, NULL): Open options menu. The menu includes "Note font size" and "Hide note body in list" options.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleEdit, (0, 240), click, "CS100"): Click to edit the title of the note. No new page or widgets appear after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleEdit, (0, 240), longClick, "CS100"): Long click on the title edit field to bring up text selection options. A new "Select All" button appears with coordinates (337, 144).
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyEdit, (0, 414), click, "Session1"): Click to edit the note content. The page remains the same after clicking, allowing the user to input or modify the note text.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyEdit, (0, 414), longClick, "Session1"): Long click on the note body to open a context menu with options including "剪切" (Cut), "复制" (Copy), "分享" (Share), and "搜索" (Search).

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I can determine that we have successfully completed the first three steps of the source test case. The next step in the source test case is to navigate back to the main notes list. Let's proceed with this step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 72), click, NULL):Click on the back button to return to the previous screen
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (), click, NULL):Click on "YES" to save changes when prompted
~~~

This action sequence attempts to navigate back to the main notes list while saving the changes made to the new note. The first action clicks the back button, which according to the current page's intent description, will prompt a dialog asking "Save changes?". The second action clicks the "YES" button to save the changes.
I understand. I'll convert the given actions into UIAutomator2 code using Python, with the device variable name as 'd'. Here's the converted code:

···
d.click(0, 72)
d(resourceId="android:id/button1").click()
···

This code does the following:
1. Clicks on the back button at coordinates (0, 72).
2. Clicks on the "YES" button using its resource ID.

I've used coordinates for the first action as they were provided and precise. For the second action, I used the resource ID as it was unique and available.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll continue with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView, (78, 279), isCompletelyDisplayed): Verify that the note title "CS100" is completely displayed.
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyView, (78, 665), isCompletelyDisplayed): Verify that the note content "Session1" is completely displayed.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/action_search, (816, 84), click, NULL): Click to open search interface.
~~~
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the given actions:

```
assert d(resourceId="com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView").exists() and d(resourceId="com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView").info['visibleBounds']['top'] >= 0
assert d(resourceId="com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyView").exists() and d(resourceId="com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyView").info['visibleBounds']['bottom'] <= d.info['displayHeight']
d.click(816, 84)
```

This code does the following:

1. Asserts that the note title element exists and is completely displayed on the screen.
2. Asserts that the note content element exists and is completely displayed on the screen.
3. Clicks on the coordinates (816, 84) to open the search interface.

Note: The `isCompletelyDisplayed` check is approximated by verifying that the element exists and its visible bounds are within the screen dimensions. This may not be 100% accurate for all scenarios but should work for most cases.

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully completed steps 1-6 of the source test case and are now at step 7, which involves searching for the created note. Let's proceed with the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/search_src_text, (192, 102), input, "cs"): Enter "cs" into the search field to perform the search.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 8 of the source test case, where we enter "cs" into the search field. After this action, we should verify the search results as per steps 9 and 10 of the source test case.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d.click(192, 102)
d.send_keys("cs")
```

This code first clicks on the search field at the specified coordinates (192, 102) and then inputs the text "cs" into the field.

#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 72), click, NULL): Click to collapse the search bar. The page transitions to the main notes list, showing the "Swiftnotes" title, a search action button, and a list of notes with favorite buttons. A new "New note" button appears at the bottom right.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/search_src_text, (192, 102), longClick, "cs"): Long click on the search text field to select the text. This action opens a context menu with options like "Select all", "Cut", "Copy", and "Paste".
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/search_src_text, (192, 102), click, "cs"): Click on the search input field to enter text "cs" for searching notes. The search results are displayed in the listView with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/listView", showing filtered notes containing "CS100" in their titles.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/search_close_btn, (816, 84), click, NULL): Clear the search query "cs" in the search bar. This action removes the search text and the clear button, restoring the search bar to its initial state with placeholder text "Search".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (960, 84), click, NULL): Click on "更多选项" to open a menu with options including Search, Backup notes, Restore notes, and Rate app.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (960, 84), longClick, NULL): Open options menu. Long-clicking this control opens a popup menu with options for "Backup notes", "Restore notes", and "Rate app".
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/listView, (0, 240), click, NULL): Click on the list view to select a note. The action doesn't navigate to a new page, but allows interaction with individual note items within the list.
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/listView, (0, 240), longClick, NULL): Long click on the list view to select multiple notes. This action does not navigate to a new page, but may trigger a selection mode or context menu for managing multiple notes.
ACTION (android.widget.RelativeLayout, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/relativeLayout, (48, 264), click, NULL): Click on the note item to view or edit its content. This action does not navigate to a new page, as the next page JSON is identical to the current page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.RelativeLayout, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/relativeLayout, (48, 264), longClick, NULL): Long click on the note item to open the note editing page. The new page contains a title edit field with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleEdit" and a body edit field with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyEdit".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView, (78, 279), click, "CS100"): Click on the note title "CS100" to open the note editing page. The new page contains a title edit field with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleEdit" and a body edit field with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyEdit".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView, (78, 279), long_click, "CS100"): Long click on the note title to open the note editing page. The new page contains a title edit field with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleEdit" and a body edit field with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyEdit".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyView, (78, 404), click, "Session1"): Click to open the note for editing. The next page shows an editable note with title "CS100" (id: com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleEdit) and body "Session1" (id: com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyEdit).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyView, (78, 404), longClick, "Session1"): Long click on the note body to open the note editing page, which contains a title edit field with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleEdit" and a body edit field with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyEdit".

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully completed steps 1 through 8 of the source test case. The next step is to verify the search results. Let's proceed with the assertions for the search results:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView, (78, 279), isDisplayed): Verify that the note title "CS100" is displayed in the search results.
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyView, (78, 404), isDisplayed): Verify that the note content "Session1" is displayed in the search results.
DONE
~~~

These assertions correspond to steps 9 and 10 of the source test case. We're verifying that both the title "CS100" and the content "Session1" are displayed in the search results after searching for "cs". 

After these assertions, we have completed all steps of the source test case, so I've included the DONE statement to indicate that the migration is complete.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the provided actions:

```
assert d(resourceId="com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView").exists()
assert d(resourceId="com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyView").exists()
```

This code performs the following actions:

1. Asserts that the note title with the resource ID "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView" is displayed.
2. Asserts that the note content with the resource ID "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyView" is displayed.

I've used the resource IDs instead of coordinates as they provide a more reliable way to identify elements, especially if the UI layout might change slightly across different devices or screen sizes. The `exists()` method is used to check if the elements are displayed on the screen.
