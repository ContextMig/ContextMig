#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to open the search functionality. Let's match this step with the appropriate action in the target app:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/action_search, (544, 72), click, NULL): Click to open the search function. A search bar with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/search_src_text" appears, allowing users to input search queries for notes.
~~~

This action corresponds to the first step in the source test case, which is clicking on the "Search" option to open the search functionality. The target app seems to have a direct search button instead of accessing it through an overflow menu, but the end result (opening the search functionality) is the same.
Based on the given information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the described action:

···
d.click(544, 72)
···

This code clicks on the coordinates (544, 72) to open the search function. Since the coordinates are provided and precise, we use them directly for the click action, which is the optimal choice as per the instructions.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL): Click to collapse the search bar and return to the main notes list. The page after clicking this control shows the main screen with a list of notes, a search button with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/action_search", and a new note button with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/newNote".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), long_click, NULL): Long click on the collapse button to return to the main page. The next page shows the list of notes with a search button (id: "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/action_search"), a new note button (id: "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/newNote"), and note items (id: "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/relativeLayout").
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/search_src_text, (128, 84), click, "Search"): Click to focus on the search input field. The page remains the same, allowing the user to enter search terms to filter notes.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case has been completed, which was to open the search functionality. Now, we need to proceed with entering the search query. Here's the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/search_src_text, (128, 84), input, "note1"): Enter "note1" into the search field to search for a non-existent note.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 in the source test case. We're using the search input field that appeared after clicking the search button in the previous step. The id and coordinates are taken from the current page's intent description for the search input field.
Based on the provided information, I will convert the action into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the code:

···
d.click(128, 84)
d.send_keys("note1")
···

This code first clicks on the search field at the specified coordinates (128, 84) and then inputs the text "note1" into the field. I chose to use coordinates as they were provided and are the preferred method according to the requirements.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL): Click the collapse button to exit the search mode and return to the main note list view. The next page shows the app title "Swiftnotes", a search action button with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/action_search", and a list of notes with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/listView".
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/search_src_text, (128, 84), longClick, "note1"): Long click on the search text field to open text selection options. The next page shows the main notes list view with a search action button (id: com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/action_search) and a new note button (id: com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/newNote).
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/search_src_text, (128, 84), click, "note1"): Click to focus on the search input field. The search input field is populated with "note1" and a clear query button with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/search_close_btn" appears next to it.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/search_src_text, (128, 84), long_click, "note1"): Long-click on the search text field to bring up a context menu with options for text manipulation, including translate, cut, copy, paste, and share.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/search_close_btn, (544, 72), click, NULL): Click to clear the search query. This action removes the text "note1" from the search input field and hides the clear button, returning the search bar to its initial state with placeholder text "Search".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/search_close_btn, (544, 72), longclick, NULL): Long click to clear the search query "note1". After the action, the search text is cleared and the search close button disappears.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (640, 72), click, NULL): Click to open more options menu. The menu includes items for Search, Backup notes, Restore notes, and Rate app.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (640, 72), longclick, NULL): Long click on "更多选项" (More options) to open additional menu options. The action does not navigate to a new page or create new visible elements based on the provided JSON data.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (), matches, "No notes found"): Verify that a message indicating no notes were found is displayed after searching for "note1".
~~~

This assertion corresponds to step 3 in the source test case, where we verify that a "no results" message is displayed after searching for a non-existent note. The exact wording might be different in the target app, so I've adjusted it to "No notes found" which is a common phrase for this scenario.

If this assertion passes, we can proceed to the next step. If it fails, we might need to adjust our approach or investigate why the expected behavior is different in the target app.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to verify that a message indicating no notes were found is displayed:

···
assert d(text="No notes found").exists()
···

This code checks if there's a TextView with the exact text "No notes found" on the screen. If it exists, the assertion passes; otherwise, it fails. This approach is more reliable than using coordinates, as it directly checks for the presence of the specific text we're looking for.

ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL): Click to collapse the search bar and return to the main note list. The next page displays the app title "Swiftnotes", a list of notes with "Title2" visible, and a "New note" button with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/newNote".
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/search_src_text, (128, 84), longClick, "note1"): Long click on the search text field to open text selection options. The next page shows the main notes list view with a search action button (id: com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/action_search) and a new note button (id: com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/newNote).
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/search_src_text, (128, 84), click, "note1"): Click to focus on the search input field. The search input field is populated with "note1" and a clear query button with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/search_close_btn" appears next to it.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/search_close_btn, (544, 72), click, NULL): Click to clear the search query. This action removes the text "note1" from the search input field and hides the clear button, returning the search bar to its initial state with placeholder text "Search".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/search_close_btn, (544, 72), longclick, NULL): Long click to clear the search query "note1". After the action, the search text is cleared and the search close button disappears.

ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (640, 72), longclick, NULL): Long click on "更多选项" (More options) to open additional menu options. The action does not navigate to a new page or create new visible elements based on the provided JSON data.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I will proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Here's my analysis and recommendation:

1. We have successfully completed the first two steps of the source test case: opening the search functionality and entering "note1" into the search field.

2. We have also verified that no notes were found for the search term "note1", which aligns with step 3 of the source test case.

3. The next step in the source test case is to clear the previous search and enter "Title2". However, in the target app, we need to clear the search field first before entering new text.

Given this analysis, here's the next action I recommend:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/search_close_btn, (544, 72), click, NULL): Click to clear the search query "note1" from the search input field.
~~~

This action will clear the current search query, preparing the search field for the next input. After this action is executed, we can proceed with entering "Title2" in the search field, which will align with step 4 of the source test case.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code for the given action:

···
d.click(544, 72)
···

This code uses the coordinates (544, 72) to click on the search close button, which will clear the search query "note1" from the search input field. As per the requirements, I've prioritized using the precise coordinates provided in the action description.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/search_src_text, (128, 84), input, "Title2"): Enter "Title2" into the search field to search for an existing note.
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already completed the first four steps of the source test case:
   - Opening the search functionality
   - Searching for a non-existent note ("note1")
   - Verifying that no results were found
   - Clearing the search query

2. The next logical step in the source test case is to search for an existing note with the title "Title2".

3. In the target app, we have a search input field with the id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/search_src_text", which corresponds to the SearchAutoComplete in the source test case.

4. We're using the same action (input) and the same value ("Title2") as in the source test case.

5. This action aligns with the intention described in the current page's intent description for the search input field.

By performing this action, we're progressing to the next step in the test case migration, searching for an existing note to verify the search functionality works correctly for notes that are present in the app.
Based on the provided information and guidelines, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(128, 84)
d.send_keys("Title2")
···

This code does the following:
1. Clicks on the search field at the coordinates (128, 84).
2. Enters the text "Title2" into the search field.

I've used the coordinates as they were provided and precise. This approach aligns with the requirement to prefer using coordinates when they are available and precise.

1. We've completed steps 1-4 of the source test case.
2. The current step (step 5) in the source test case is to verify that a note with the title "Title2" is displayed in the search results.
3. From the current page's intent description, we can see that there's a TextView with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView" and text "Title2", which corresponds to the note title we're looking for.
4. Therefore, we can assert that this TextView matches the expected title "Title2" to verify the search result.

This assertion aligns with the source test case's intention to verify the search results, adapting to the specific implementation in the target application.
Based on the given information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the assertion:

···
assert d(resourceId="com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView", text="Title2").exists()
···

This code checks if a TextView with the resource ID "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView" and the text "Title2" exists on the screen. This assertion verifies that a note with the title "Title2" is displayed in the search results.

Note that I didn't use the coordinates (52, 202) in this case because the resourceId and text combination should be sufficient to uniquely identify the element. Using coordinates might make the test less robust if there are slight changes in the UI layout. However, if you specifically want to use coordinates, you can modify the code as follows:

···
assert d(resourceId="com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView", text="Title2").bounds()[0][0] == 52 and d(resourceId="com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView", text="Title2").bounds()[0][1] == 202
···

This alternative checks if the top-left corner of the element is at the specified coordinates (52, 202).

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided information, we are currently at step 6 of the source test case. We have successfully searched for "Title2" and verified its presence. The next step in the source test case is to verify the subtitle of the found note. Let's proceed with this step:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyView, (52, 285), matches, "Text2"): Verify that the body of the found note contains the text "Text2".
~~~

This assertion checks if the body of the note (which corresponds to the subtitle in the source test case) matches the expected text "Text2". The element ID and coordinates are taken from the current page's intent description, which shows the body view of the note.
Based on the given input, I'll convert the ASSERT action into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the corresponding code:

···
assert d(resourceId="com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyView").get_text() == "Text2"
···

In this case, I've used the resourceId to locate the element since it's provided and unique. However, if you prefer using coordinates as mentioned in the requirements, here's an alternative version:

···
assert d(clickable=True).get_text(52, 285) == "Text2"
···

Both versions should work, but the coordinate-based one might be more reliable if the app's layout is consistent across different devices.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated most of the steps from the source test case to the target application. Let's proceed with the final step of the source test case:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/search_close_btn, (544, 72), click, NULL): Click on the clear query button to reset the search.
DONE
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already performed the search for "Title2" and verified the results.
2. The last step in the source test case is to clear the search query.
3. In the target application, we have a specific button for clearing the search query, which is represented by the ImageView with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/search_close_btn".
4. By clicking this button, we'll clear the search query, effectively resetting the search as required in the source test case.
5. After this action, we have successfully migrated all steps from the source test case to the target application, so we can conclude with "DONE".

This completes the test case migration, ensuring that all functionalities tested in the source application are also verified in the target application.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(544, 72)
···

This code uses the coordinates (544, 72) to click on the clear query button, which resets the search. The coordinate-based approach is preferred as per the instructions, and it's the most precise method for interacting with the UI element in this case.
