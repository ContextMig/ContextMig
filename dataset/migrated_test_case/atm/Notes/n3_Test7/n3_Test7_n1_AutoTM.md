#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (344, 183), click, "Sort"): Opens a submenu with sorting options for notes, including "By title", "By creation (oldest first)", "By creation (newest first)", and "By last changing".
~~~

Explanation:
1. The source test case's first step is to open the options menu, which has already been executed successfully in the target app (as shown in the Executed Action Sequence).
2. The next step in the source test case is to click on the "Settings" option. However, in the target app, we don't see a direct "Settings" option in the current page's intentions.
3. The closest match in terms of functionality appears to be the "Sort" option, which opens a submenu with various options. This could potentially lead us to more settings or options that might include what we're looking for in the source test case.
4. By clicking on "Sort", we're progressing in the app's navigation, which might bring us closer to finding the Settings or equivalent functionality.
5. If this action doesn't lead us to the desired Settings page, we'll need to explore other options in subsequent steps.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d.click(344, 183)
···

This code uses the coordinates provided (344, 183) to click on the "Sort" option, which opens a submenu with sorting options for notes. The coordinates are used as the preferred method of interaction, as specified in the requirements.

Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (471.0, 205), longClick, "Sort"): Long click on the "Sort" option to return to the main note list page
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already completed the first step of the source test case by opening the options menu.
2. The second step in the source test case is to click on "Settings", but in the target app, we don't see a direct "Settings" option in the current page's intentions.
3. To proceed, we need to return to the main page where we might find the "Settings" option.
4. From the current page's intentions, we can see that a long click on the "Sort" option will return us to the main notes list page.
5. This action will allow us to potentially access the "Settings" option in the next step, aligning with the source test case's intention to navigate to the Settings screen.
Based on the provided action and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

```
d.long_click(471, 205, 1)
```

This code performs a long click operation at the coordinates (471, 205) for 1 second, which corresponds to the "Sort" option as described in the action. The use of coordinates is preferred as per the requirements, and the long click duration of 1 second is included as specified in the common operations guidelines.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently on the main note list page after executing the sorting action. Let's proceed with the next step of the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (608, 64), click, NULL): Click to open more options menu to access the Settings option
~~~

Explanation:
1. We have already executed the first step of the source test case, which was to open the options menu.
2. The next step in the source test case is to click on the "Settings" option.
3. Since we are now on the main note list page, we need to open the options menu again to access the Settings option.
4. The action to open the options menu is similar to the first action in the executed sequence, so we can use the same coordinates and element type.

This action should open the options menu, allowing us to proceed with selecting the "Settings" option in the next step.
Based on the provided action and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to click on the ImageButton to open the more options menu:

```
d.click(608, 64)
```

This code uses the coordinates (608, 64) to perform the click action, which is the preferred method as per the requirements. The device variable name is set to 'd' as specified in the input.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I can see that we have successfully navigated to the Settings page of the target application. This aligns with step 2 of the source test case. Now, we need to verify that the Settings screen is displayed correctly, which corresponds to step 3 of the source test case. Here's the next action we should take:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/action_bar_title, (96, 87), isDisplayed, "Settings"): Verify that the "Settings" text is displayed in the action bar, confirming that the Settings screen has been opened successfully.
DONE
~~~

This assertion checks if the action bar title displays "Settings", which confirms that we have successfully navigated to the Settings screen. If this assertion passes, it means we have completed all steps of the source test case in the target application. 

The "DONE" statement indicates that we have successfully migrated all steps of the source test case to the target application. We opened the options menu (step 1), clicked on the Settings option (step 2), and now we're verifying that the Settings screen is displayed (step 3).
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to verify that the "Settings" text is displayed in the action bar:

···
assert d(resourceId="android:id/action_bar_title", text="Settings").exists()
···

This code checks if an element with the resource ID "android:id/action_bar_title" and the text "Settings" exists on the screen. This assertion verifies that the Settings screen has been opened successfully by confirming the presence of the "Settings" text in the action bar.
