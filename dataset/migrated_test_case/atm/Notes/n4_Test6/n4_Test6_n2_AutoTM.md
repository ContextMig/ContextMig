````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll continue with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've successfully created a new note with the title "CS200" and content "Session1".
2. We've navigated back to the main screen after saving the changes.

The next step in the source test case is to click on the sticky note icon. However, in the target app (Swiftnotes), we don't see a direct equivalent for this action. Instead, we need to focus on the underlying purpose, which seems to be related to sorting or organizing notes.

Given the current page's intentions, the closest action that might relate to organizing notes is opening the options menu. Let's proceed with this action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (960, 84), click, NULL): Open options menu to look for sorting or organizing options
~~~

This action should open the options menu, allowing us to explore if there are any sorting or organizing features available in the target app.
Based on the provided action and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(960, 84)
···

This code directly uses the coordinates provided (960, 84) to perform a click action, which should open the options menu as described. Using coordinates is the preferred method as per the requirements, and it's also the most precise way to interact with the specific UI element in this case.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (480, 84), click, NULL): Click on the "Backup notes" option to initiate the note backup process. The action does not navigate to a new page, but may trigger a backup operation or show a confirmation dialog.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (480, 84), longClick, NULL): Long press to open the "Backup notes" dialog, which contains a confirmation message and YES/NO buttons (android:id/button1 and android:id/button2).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/title, (528, 123), click, "Backup notes"): Click on "Backup notes" option to open a confirmation dialog for backing up current notes. The dialog contains a title "Backup notes", a message "Are you sure you want to backup current notes?", and two buttons: "NO" (id: android:id/button2) and "YES" (id: android:id/button1).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/title, (528, 123), longClick, "Backup notes"): Long press on "Backup notes" option opens a confirmation dialog with "YES" and "NO" buttons to confirm backing up current notes.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/title, (528, 267), click, "Restore notes"): Click on "Restore notes" to open a confirmation dialog for restoring backup notes. The dialog contains a title "Restore notes" (id: android:id/alertTitle), a message, and two buttons: "NO" (id: android:id/button2) and "YES" (id: android:id/button1).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/title, (528, 267), long_click, "Restore notes"): Long click on "Restore notes" to open a confirmation dialog for restoring backup notes. The dialog contains a title "Restore notes", a message about the restoration process, and two buttons: "NO" (id: android:id/button2) and "YES" (id: android:id/button1).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/title, (528, 411), click, "Rate app"): Click on "Rate app" option to open a confirmation dialog for rating the app in Play Store. The dialog contains a title "Rate app", a message, and two buttons: "NO" (id: android:id/button2) and "YES" (id: android:id/button1).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/title, (528, 411), long_click, "Rate app"): Long click on "Rate app" option to open a confirmation dialog asking if the user wants to open the app in Play Store for rating. The dialog contains "YES" and "NO" buttons with IDs "android:id/button1" and "android:id/button2" respectively.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've successfully created a new note with the title "CS200" and content "Session1".
2. We've returned to the main screen.
3. We've opened the options menu.

The next step in the source test case is to click on the sticky note icon and then click on the first tab in the tab host. However, the current page's intentions don't show these exact options. Instead, we have various settings options like "Backup notes", "Restore notes", and "Rate app".

Given this situation, we need to adapt our approach. The goal of the next steps in the source test case seems to be about organizing or sorting the notes. Let's try to find a similar functionality in the target app.

Here's what I propose for the next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/title, (528, 123), click, "Backup notes"): Click on "Backup notes" option to open a confirmation dialog for backing up current notes.
~~~

I'm choosing this action because:
1. It's related to managing notes, which aligns with the general direction of the source test case.
2. It might lead us to more options for organizing or sorting notes.

After this action, we'll need to evaluate the new state of the app to determine our next steps. We might need to navigate back or explore other options if this doesn't lead us to sorting functionality.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(528, 123)
···

This code uses the coordinates (528, 123) to click on the "Backup notes" option. As per the requirements, using coordinates is the preferred method when they are provided precisely, which is the case here.

Based on the provided information, I can see that we have successfully completed the first 4 steps of the source test case. We are now at a point where we need to decide on the next action. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next step:

1. We have created a new note with the title "CS200" and content "Session1".
2. We have returned to the main screen.
3. We have opened the options menu and selected "Backup notes".

The next step in the source test case is to click on the sticky note icon, but our current page shows a backup confirmation dialog. This indicates that the target app's workflow is different from the source app. We need to handle this situation before we can proceed with the next step of the source test case.

Given the current page's intentions, we should respond to the backup dialog before continuing. The most appropriate action would be to cancel the backup operation so we can return to the main notes list page. Here's the next action we should take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (585, 1015), click, NULL):Click the "NO" button to cancel the backup operation and return to the main notes list page
~~~

This action will dismiss the backup dialog and return us to the main screen, where we can continue with the next steps of the source test case. After this action, we should be able to proceed with finding a way to sort or organize the notes, which aligns with the next steps in the source test case.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code for the given action:

···
d.click(585, 1015)
···

This code uses the coordinates (585, 1015) to click the "NO" button, which cancels the backup operation and returns to the main notes list page. I've chosen to use the coordinates as they are precise and available, which is the preferred method according to the requirements.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case semantics, it appears that we have successfully completed steps 1-4 of the source test case. We've created a new note, entered the title and content, and navigated back to the main screen. The next step in the source test case involves clicking on a sticky note icon, but this exact feature doesn't seem to be present in the target app. Instead, we should focus on finding a way to sort or organize the notes, which aligns with the intent of the next few steps in the source test case.

Let's proceed with trying to find a sorting option:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (960, 84), click, NULL): Click on the options menu to look for sorting or organizing options
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/title, (528, 123), matches, "Backup notes"): Verify that the options menu contains "Backup notes" option
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (960, 84), click, NULL): Click on the options menu again to close it and return to the main screen
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/listView, (0, 240), click, NULL): Click on the list view to check if there's any sorting option or if clicking triggers a sorting action
~~~
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the given actions:

···
d.click(960, 84)
assert d(resourceId="com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/title", text="Backup notes").exists()
d.click(960, 84)
d.click(0, 240)
···

This code performs the following actions:

1. Clicks on the options menu at coordinates (960, 84).
2. Verifies that the "Backup notes" option exists in the options menu.
3. Clicks on the options menu again at the same coordinates to close it.
4. Clicks on the list view at coordinates (0, 240).

Note that I've used the coordinates provided in the input for the click actions, as per the requirement to prefer coordinates when they are precise. For the assertion, I've used a combination of the resourceId and text attributes to verify the existence of the "Backup notes" option.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully completed steps 1-4 of the source test case. We've created a new note with the title "CS200" and content "Session1", and returned to the main screen. However, we haven't been able to find a direct equivalent for steps 5-7, which involve sorting the notes. Let's try to find an alternative way to verify the order of the notes.

Here's the next step we should take:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView, (), matches, "CS200"): Verify that the newly created note with title "CS200" is visible in the list
~~~

This assertion will check if the newly created note is visible in the list, which partially fulfills the intention of steps 8 and 9 in the source test case. If this assertion passes, we can consider the test case partially migrated. If it fails, we may need to explore other options to locate and verify the newly created note.
Based on the provided information, I'll convert the given assertion into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the translation:

···
assert d(resourceId="com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView", text="CS200").exists()
···

This code checks if a TextView with the resource ID "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView" and text "CS200" exists on the screen, which verifies that the newly created note with the title "CS200" is visible in the list.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll continue with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've successfully created a new note with the title "CS200" and content "Session1".
2. We've navigated back to the main screen and verified that the new note is visible.
3. We've explored the options menu but didn't find a direct sorting option.

The next step in the source test case is to click on the sticky note icon and then click on the first tab in the tab host. However, we don't see these exact elements in the target app. Instead, we need to find a way to sort or organize the notes.

Given that we don't have a direct sorting option, we might need to explore other ways to verify the order of notes. Let's try to add another note and then verify the order. Here's the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/newNote, (795, 1515), click, NULL): Click to create a new note
~~~

This action aims to create another note so we can verify the order of multiple notes, which is closer to the intent of the original test case.
Based on the given information, I'll convert the action into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Since coordinates are provided and are the preferred choice, I'll use them for the click operation.

Here's the converted code:

···
d.click(795, 1515)
···

This code uses the device variable 'd' to perform a click operation at the coordinates (795, 1515), which corresponds to the action of clicking to create a new note.

ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 72), longClick, NULL): Long press on the back button to trigger a save changes dialog. The dialog contains a message "Save changes?" and two buttons: "NO" (id: android:id/button2) and "YES" (id: android:id/button1).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/action_note_colour, (816, 84), click, NULL): Opens a dialog to change the note color. The dialog includes a title "Change note colour" and a grid of color options represented by 9 clickable FrameLayout elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/action_note_colour, (816, 84), long_click, NULL): Long click to open note color options. No new page appears, but a color selection dialog or menu likely appears (not visible in the provided JSON).
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (960, 84), click, NULL): Open options menu. A popup menu appears with two options: "Note font size" and "Hide note body in list".

Based on the provided information, I'll continue the test case migration. Here's the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleEdit, (0, 240), input, "CS100"): Enter "CS100" as the title of the new note
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already created a note with the title "CS200" and content "Session1".
2. The next logical step in the source test case is to create another note to test the sorting functionality.
3. Although the source test case doesn't explicitly mention creating a "CS100" note, we need this to verify the sorting order later (as per step 8 and 9 of the source test).
4. We're using the same EditText field (titleEdit) as before to input the new title.

After executing this action, we should proceed with entering the content for this new note and then return to the main screen to test the sorting functionality.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code for the given action:

···
d.click(0, 240)
d.send_keys("CS100")
···

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (0, 240) where the EditText for the title is located, and then inputs the text "CS100" into that field.

Based on the provided information, I'll continue the test case migration. Here's the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyEdit, (0, 414), input, "Session2"):Enter "Session2" as the content of the new note
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in the source test case, where we input content into the note body. We're using "Session2" instead of "Session1" to differentiate it from the previous note.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code for the given action:

···
d.click(0, 414)
d.send_keys("Session2")
···

This code first clicks on the EditText at the specified coordinates (0, 414) and then sends the text "Session2" to the input field.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've successfully created two notes: "CS200" with content "Session1" and "CS100" with content "Session2".
2. We're currently on the note editing screen for the "CS100" note.
3. The next step in the source test case is to return to the main screen.

Given this, here's the next action to take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 72), click, NULL):Click the back button to return to the main screen
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (), click, NULL):Click "YES" to save changes and return to the main screen
~~~

This action corresponds to step 4 in the source test case: "RETURN: Navigate back to the main screen". We're using the back button and confirming to save changes, which should bring us back to the main screen where all notes are listed.
Based on the provided actions, I will convert them into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the code:

```
d.click(0, 72)
d(resourceId="android:id/button1").click()
```

This code does the following:

1. Clicks the back button at coordinates (0, 72) to return to the main screen.
2. Clicks the "YES" button using its resource ID to save changes and return to the main screen.

I've used the coordinates for the first action as they were provided and precise. For the second action, I used the resource ID as it was unique and non-empty.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided information, I'll continue with the next step in the test case migration. Here's my response:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView, (), matches, "CS100"): Verify that the newly created note with title "CS100" is visible in the list
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView, (), matches, "CS200"): Verify that the previously created note with title "CS200" is also visible in the list
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've successfully migrated steps 1-4 of the source test case by creating two notes with titles "CS200" and "CS100".
2. Steps 5-7 of the source test case involve sorting the notes, but we couldn't find a direct sorting option in the target app's interface. We attempted to look for sorting options in the menu but didn't find any.
3. Steps 8-9 of the source test case involve verifying the order of the notes. Since we couldn't sort the notes, we'll simply verify that both notes are present in the list.
4. The assertions check for the presence of both "CS100" and "CS200" notes in the list, which aligns with the intent of the original test case to verify the notes' existence after creation.

These assertions complete the migration of the test case, adapting to the available functionality in the target app while maintaining the core purpose of verifying the creation and presence of notes.
Based on the provided actions, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the assertions:

···
assert d(resourceId="com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView", text="CS100").exists()
assert d(resourceId="com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView", text="CS200").exists()
···

This code checks for the existence of two TextView elements with the specified resource ID and text content. It verifies that both the newly created note "CS100" and the previously created note "CS200" are visible in the list.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information and the executed action sequence, it appears that we have successfully migrated most of the steps from the source test case to the target application. Let's review the progress and determine the next step:

1. We've created a new note with title "CS200" and content "Session1".
2. We've attempted to find sorting options but couldn't locate them directly.
3. We've created another note with title "CS100" and content "Session2".
4. We've verified the presence of both "CS100" and "CS200" notes in the list.

The main step we haven't addressed yet is sorting the notes. Since we couldn't find a direct sorting option in the menu, we might need to explore alternative ways to achieve this or verify if the notes are automatically sorted.

Let's try to verify the order of the notes:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView, (78, 279), matches, "CS100"): Verify that the first note title displayed is "CS100"
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView, (78, 665), matches, "CS200"): Verify that the second note title displayed is "CS200"
DONE
~~~

This response attempts to verify the order of the notes as specified in the source test case. If these assertions pass, it would indicate that the notes are automatically sorted in the desired order (alphabetically by title). If they fail, we might need to explore further options for sorting or consider that the target application might have a different default sorting mechanism.

The 'DONE' statement is included because we have addressed all the main steps from the source test case: creating notes, attempting to sort (even though we couldn't find a direct option), and verifying the presence and order of the notes. If you find that any crucial step is missing or if the assertions fail, please provide that information, and we can explore further actions.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the given actions:

```
assert d(resourceId="com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView", className="android.widget.TextView").get_text() == "CS100"
assert d.xpath('//*[@resource-id="com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView" and @class="android.widget.TextView"][2]').get_text() == "CS200"
```

This code performs the following actions:
1. Checks if the first note title (at coordinates 78, 279) matches "CS100".
2. Checks if the second note title (at coordinates 78, 665) matches "CS200".

I've used the resourceId and className for the first assertion, and XPath for the second to ensure we're checking the second occurrence of the TextView with the given resourceId. This approach should be more reliable than using exact coordinates, especially if the screen size or resolution might vary.
