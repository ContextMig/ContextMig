#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided function description and the current page's intent description, I'll start the test case migration with the first step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, me.writeily:id/fab_expand_menu_button, (810, 1542), click, NULL): Click to expand the floating action menu to access the "Add" functionality
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, me.writeily:id/create_note, (810, 1542), click, NULL): Click on the "create_note" button to create a new note
~~~

This action sequence corresponds to the first step in the source test case: "Click on the 'Add' menu item to create a new note." In the target app, we need to first expand the floating action menu and then click on the "create_note" button to achieve the same functionality.
Based on the provided information and requirements, I'll convert the given actions into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the generated code:

···
d.click(810, 1542)
d.click(810, 1542)
···

This code performs the following actions:

1. Clicks on the coordinates (810, 1542) to expand the floating action menu.
2. Clicks again on the same coordinates (810, 1542) to create a new note.

I've used the coordinates provided in the actions, as they are precise and it's the preferred method according to the requirements. The device variable name is set to 'd' as specified in the input.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in migrating the test case. The source test case starts with creating a new note, and we've just expanded the floating action menu in the target app. The next logical step would be to create a new note.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, me.writeily:id/create_note, (810, 1074), click, NULL): Click to create a new note
~~~

This action corresponds to step 1 in the source test case: "Click on the 'Add' menu item to create a new note." We're using the create_note button that was revealed after expanding the floating action menu.
Based on the given information, I'll convert the action into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the code:

```
d.click(810, 1074)
```

This code uses the coordinates (810, 1074) to click on the ImageButton for creating a new note. I've chosen to use coordinates as they are precise and available, which is the preferred method according to the requirements.

Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. The source test case is currently at step 2, which involves inputting the title of the new note. Let's match this step with the available actions on the current page of the target app.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (216, 72), input, "CS200"): Enter "CS200" as the title of the new note
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 of the source test case. We're using the edit_note_title EditText field to input the title "CS200". This matches the functionality of entering a title for a new note in both the source and target applications.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

```
d.click(216, 72)
d.send_keys("CS200")
```

This code will click on the EditText field at the specified coordinates (216, 72) and then input the text "CS200" as the title of the new note.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently in the process of creating a new note in the target application. Let's proceed with the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 245), input, "Session1"): Enter "Session1" as the content of the new note
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in the source test case, where we input the content of the new note. We're using the note content area identified in the current page's intentions to input the text "Session1".
Based on the given information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the specified action:

···
d.click(0, 245)
d.send_keys("Session1")
···

This code performs the following steps:
1. Clicks on the specified coordinates (0, 245) where the EditText is located.
2. Sends the input text "Session1" to the clicked EditText.

I've used the coordinates as the primary method for interaction, as per the requirements. The code uses the device variable name 'd' as specified in the input.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll analyze the current state of the test migration and determine the next step:

1. We've successfully created a new note with the title "CS200" and content "Session1", which matches steps 1-3 of the source test case.

2. The next step in the source test case (step 4) is to return to the main screen.

3. Looking at the current page's intentions, we can see that there's an action to return to the previous page using the back button.

Therefore, the next logical step in our test migration would be:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 72), click, NULL):Click on the back button to return to the previous page, which is the main notes list
~~~

This action corresponds to step 4 in the source test case, which is to return to the main screen. After executing this action, we should be back on the main notes list, ready to proceed with the next steps of the test case.
Based on the provided action and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(0, 72)
···

This code uses the coordinate-based click method, which is the preferred approach as per the given instructions. The action clicks on the back button located at coordinates (0, 72) to return to the previous page, which is the main notes list.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided information, I'll analyze the current state of the test case migration and determine the next step. Here's my response:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/note_title, (264, 867), matches, "CS200"): Verify that the newly created note with title "CS200" is displayed in the list
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/note_extra, (264, 944), contains, "最后修改"): Verify that the last modified time is displayed for the newly created note
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (960, 84), click, NULL): Open the options menu to access sorting options
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've successfully completed steps 1-4 of the source test case, which involve creating a new note with the title "CS200" and content "Session1", and then returning to the main screen.

2. The next step in the source test case (step 5) involves clicking on a sticky note icon, which doesn't seem to have a direct equivalent in the target app based on the provided intentions. Therefore, we'll skip this step and move on to the sorting functionality (steps 6-7 in the source test case).

3. Before proceeding with the sorting, it's important to verify that the newly created note is displayed correctly. Hence, I've added two assertions to check for the presence of the "CS200" note and its last modified time.

4. To access the sorting options, we need to open the options menu. This is achieved by clicking on the ImageView at coordinates (960, 84), which opens the options menu according to the intentions description.

5. In the next step, we'll need to look for sorting options within this menu to complete the migration of steps 6-7 from the source test case.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the given actions:

```
assert d(resourceId="me.writeily:id/note_title", text="CS200").exists()
assert "最后修改" in d(resourceId="me.writeily:id/note_extra").get_text()
d.click(960, 84)
```

In this code:

1. We first assert that a TextView with the resource ID "me.writeily:id/note_title" and text "CS200" exists. This verifies that the newly created note with the title "CS200" is displayed in the list.

2. We then assert that the text "最后修改" (which means "Last modified" in Chinese) is contained within the TextView with the resource ID "me.writeily:id/note_extra". This checks that the last modified time is displayed for the newly created note.

3. Finally, we perform a click action at the coordinates (960, 84) to open the options menu for accessing sorting options.

Note that I've used the resource IDs where available for more reliable element identification, and coordinates for the click action as specified in the requirements. The device variable name 'd' is used as provided in the input.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated the first 4 steps of the source test case. We've created a new note with the title "CS200" and content "Session1", and returned to the main screen. Now, we need to proceed with the next steps of the test case, which involve sorting the notes. Let's continue with the migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/title, (528, 267), click, "设置"): Click on "设置" (Settings) to open the settings page. This action corresponds to step 5 in the source test case, where we're trying to access sorting options.
~~~

This action is chosen because:
1. We've already completed steps 1-4 of the source test case.
2. Step 5 in the source test case involves clicking on a sticky note icon, which is likely related to sorting or organizing notes.
3. In the target app, we don't see a direct sorting option in the current page's intentions, but we do see a "Settings" option. It's common for sorting options to be located in the settings of note-taking apps.
4. By accessing the settings, we might find options related to sorting or organizing notes, which would allow us to continue with the next steps of the test case.

After this action is executed, we'll need to examine the new page's intentions to find options related to sorting notes, and then proceed with the next steps of the migration.
Based on the provided information, I'll convert the action into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the code:

```
d.click(528, 267)
```

This code uses the coordinates (528, 267) to click on the "设置" (Settings) button. I've chosen to use coordinates as they are precise and available in the input. This action will open the settings page, allowing access to sorting options as described in step 5 of the source test case.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully created a new note with the title "CS200" and content "Session1", which aligns with steps 1-4 of the source test case. We have also navigated back to the main screen and verified the presence of the newly created note.

However, the last executed action opened the settings page instead of accessing the sorting options directly. This suggests that the target app's structure differs slightly from the source app. We need to adjust our approach to find the sorting functionality.

Let's try to navigate back to the main screen and look for a different way to access the sorting options:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 72), click, NULL): Click the back button to return to the main page with the list of notes
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/note_title, (264, 867), matches, "CS200"): Verify that the note with title "CS200" is still present in the list
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, me.writeily:id/search_button, (960, 84), click, NULL): Click on the search button, which might reveal additional options including sorting
~~~

This response attempts to return to the main screen, verify the presence of our created note, and then explore the search button as a potential way to access sorting options. If this doesn't lead to the sorting functionality, we'll need to explore other UI elements on the main screen in the next iteration.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the provided actions:

```
d.click(0, 72)
assert d(resourceId="me.writeily:id/note_title", text="CS200").exists()
d.click(960, 84)
```

This code does the following:

1. Clicks the back button at coordinates (0, 72) to return to the main page with the list of notes.
2. Verifies that a note with the title "CS200" is present in the list.
3. Clicks on the search button at coordinates (960, 84), which might reveal additional options including sorting.

Note that I've used the coordinate-based approach as per your preference, except for the assertion where I've used the resourceId and text attributes for more reliable verification.

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have completed steps 1-4 of the source test case, and we're currently trying to find a way to sort the notes. However, the target app seems to have a different structure for accessing sorting options. Let's try to continue the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 72), click, NULL): Click the back button to return to the main page with the list of notes
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/note_title, (264, 867), matches, "CS200"): Verify that the note with title "CS200" is still present in the list
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (960, 84), click, NULL): Open the options menu to access sorting options
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (480, 84), click, NULL): Click to open the "Import from device" option, which might reveal additional menu items including sorting options
~~~
Based on the provided actions and requirements, I'll convert them into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the implementation:

···
# Click the back button to return to the main page with the list of notes
d.click(0, 72)

# Verify that the note with title "CS200" is still present in the list
assert d(resourceId="me.writeily:id/note_title", text="CS200").exists()

# Open the options menu to access sorting options
d.click(960, 84)

# Click to open the "Import from device" option, which might reveal additional menu items including sorting options
d.click(480, 84)
···

Note: I've used the device variable name 'd' as specified in the input. The code prioritizes using coordinates where available, as per the requirements. For the assertion, I've used the resourceId along with the text attribute to verify the existence of the "CS200" note, as it provides a more robust check than relying solely on coordinates for text verification.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we are still trying to find a way to sort the notes, which corresponds to steps 5-7 in the source test case. However, the target app seems to have a different structure for accessing sorting options. Let's try to find an alternative way to sort the notes.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/title, (528, 267), click, "设置"): Click on "设置" (Settings) to open the settings page. This might contain sorting options or preferences that affect the note order.
~~~
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the action:

```
d.click(528, 267)
```

This code clicks on the coordinates (528, 267) where the "设置" (Settings) text is located. I've used the coordinates as they were provided and are precise, which is the preferred method according to the requirements.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case semantics, it appears that we've successfully created a new note with the title "CS200" and content "Session1", and we've been trying to find a way to sort the notes. However, the target app seems to have a different structure for accessing sorting options compared to the source app. Let's try to find an alternative way to sort the notes or verify their order.

Given the current page's intent description, we're on the settings page. Since we couldn't find direct sorting options in the main menu or settings, let's return to the main page and check if the notes are already sorted alphabetically by default. If they are, we can verify the order without explicitly sorting them.

Here's the next step I propose:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 72), click, NULL): Click the back button to return to the main page with the list of notes.
~~~

This action will take us back to the main page where we can see the list of notes. After this, we'll check the order of the notes to see if they're already sorted alphabetically.
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(0, 72)
···

This code uses the coordinate-based click method, which is the preferred approach as per the instructions. The action describes clicking an ImageButton at coordinates (0, 72), which is interpreted as the back button to return to the main page with the list of notes.

#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Writeily Pro, (48, 115), click, "Writeily Pro"): Click on the "Writeily Pro" title to potentially navigate to the app's main page or refresh the current page. The action does not result in any visible changes to the page layout or elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (48, 115), longClick, "Writeily Pro"): Long click on the app title "Writeily Pro" to trigger a contextual menu or additional options. However, the next page JSON shows no changes, indicating that this action may not have any visible effect on the user interface.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, me.writeily:id/search_button, (816, 84), click, NULL): Click to open the search functionality. A search bar with id "me.writeily:id/search_src_text" appears, allowing users to search for notes.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case, it appears that we have successfully completed steps 1-4 of the source test case, which involve creating a new note with the title "CS200" and content "Session1". We've also attempted to find sorting options, but the exact path to access these options in the target app seems different from the source app.

The next step in the source test case (step 5) involves clicking on a sticky note icon, which doesn't seem to have a direct equivalent in the target app. Instead, we should focus on finding a way to sort the notes, which is the ultimate goal of steps 5-7 in the source test case.

Given the current state and available actions, let's try to find a sorting option:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (960, 84), click, NULL):Open the options menu to look for sorting options
~~~

This action should open the options menu, where we might find sorting options or a way to access them.
Understood. I'll convert the given action into UIAutomator2 code using Python, focusing on the coordinates provided. Here's the code:

···
d.click(960, 84)
···

This code will click on the ImageView at the coordinates (960, 84) to open the options menu for sorting options. Since coordinates are provided and are precise, I've used them directly in the `click()` method, which is the preferred approach as per your instructions.
