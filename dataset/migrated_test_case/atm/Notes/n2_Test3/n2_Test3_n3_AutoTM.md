#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to create a new note. Let's match this action with the available intentions on the current page.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, me.writeily:id/fab_expand_menu_button, (540, 1428), click, NULL): Click to expand the floating action menu to reveal options for creating a new note
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, me.writeily:id/create_note, (540, 1428), click, NULL): Click on the create new note button to start creating a new note
~~~

This sequence of actions corresponds to the first step in the source test case: "Click on the 'New note' button to create a new note." We first expand the floating action menu to reveal the option for creating a new note, and then click on that option to start creating a new note.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given actions:

···
d.click(540, 1428)
d.click(540, 1428)
···

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the floating action menu button at coordinates (540, 1428) to expand the menu.
2. Clicks on the create new note button at the same coordinates (540, 1428) to start creating a new note.

The code uses the coordinate-based approach as requested, which is the preferred method according to the given requirements.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to create a new note. Let's proceed with this step using the expanded floating action menu.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, me.writeily:id/create_note, (540, 1116), click, NULL): Click to create a new note
~~~

This action corresponds to step 1 in the source test case: "Click on the 'New note' button to create a new note." The target app uses a floating action button to create a new note, which has been revealed by expanding the menu in the previous action.
Based on the provided input and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code for the given action:

···
d.click(540, 1116)
···

This code uses the coordinates (540, 1116) to click on the ImageButton for creating a new note. I've chosen to use the coordinates as they are precise and available, which is the preferred method according to the requirements.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL): Click the back button to return to the previous page, which displays a list of notes including "Title1" and "Title2" with their last modified dates.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), click, "标题"): Click to focus on the note title field for editing. No new page or elements appear as this action only activates the text input for the title.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), long_click, "标题"): Long click on the note title field to select text or bring up text editing options. No new page or dialog appears, as the current and next page JSONs are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (528, 72), click, NULL): Click to open the share options for the current note. The next page is not available, but typically this would open a system share dialog with various sharing options.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (528, 72), longclick, NULL): Long press on the share button to open sharing options. No new page appears, but a sharing menu or dialog is likely to be displayed with various sharing options.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_preview, (624, 72), click, NULL): Click to switch from edit mode to preview mode. The page changes to display a WebView for previewing the content, and the action_preview button is replaced with an action_edit button to allow switching back to edit mode.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_preview, (624, 72), long_click, NULL): Long click on the preview button to possibly reveal additional options or perform a specific action related to previewing the note content. No new page or dialog appears after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 180), click, NULL): Click to focus and enable text input in the note content area. No new page or widgets appear as this action activates the existing text input field.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 180), longClick, NULL): Long click on the note content area to open a context menu for text editing options. The context menu may include options like copy, paste, cut, or select all.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the step of creating a new note in the target application. This corresponds to step 1 in the source test case. Let's proceed with the next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), click, NULL): Click to focus on the note title field for editing
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), input, "Title3"): Enter "Title3" as the title of the new note
~~~

This action combines steps 1 and 2 from the source test case. We first click on the title field to focus it, then input the title "Title3". This matches the functionality of entering a title for the new note in the source test case.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given actions:

···
d.click(144, 64)
d.click(144, 64)
d.send_keys("Title3")
···

This code does the following:
1. Clicks on the coordinates (144, 64) to focus on the note title field.
2. Clicks again on the same coordinates to ensure the input field is ready.
3. Sends the keys "Title3" to input the title of the new note.

I've used the coordinates as preferred in the requirements, and followed the instruction to use d.click() followed by d.send_keys() for text input.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL): Click the back button to return to the previous page, which is the main page displaying a list of notes including "Title1", "Title2", and "Title3" with their last modified dates.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), longClick, NULL): Long press on the "Go back" button to return to the previous page. The next page shows a list of notes with titles "Title2", "Title1", and "Title3", and includes a search button with id "me.writeily:id/search_button" and a floating action button with id "me.writeily:id/fab_expand_menu_button".
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), click, "Title3"): Click on the note title field to edit the title. No new page or widgets appear as this action allows in-place editing of the existing title.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), longClick, "Title3"): Long click on the note title to open a text selection menu with options for translation, cut, copy, paste, and share. The menu appears with elements having descriptions "翻译所选文字", "剪切", "复制", "粘贴", and "分享".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (528, 72), click, NULL): Click to share the current note. A system share dialog appears with options to share the note through various apps.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (528, 72), longClick, NULL): Long click on the share button to open sharing options. No new page appears, but a sharing menu or dialog is likely to be displayed with various sharing options.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_preview, (624, 72), click, NULL): Click to preview the note content. The page changes to a preview mode with a WebView to display the formatted note, and the action button changes to "me.writeily:id/action_edit" for returning to edit mode.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_preview, (624, 72), longClick, NULL): Long click on the preview button to potentially open additional options or perform a specific action related to previewing the note. However, the action does not lead to a new page or add new elements, as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 180), click, NULL): Click to focus on the note content area for editing. No new page or widgets appear, as this action simply allows the user to start typing or editing the note content.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 180), longClick, NULL): Long click on the note content area to potentially bring up a context menu or selection options for text editing. No new page or widgets appear after this action.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I will proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We have successfully created a new note and entered "Title3" as the title.
2. The next step in the source test case is to enter "Note2" as the body content of the new note.

Given the current page's intentions, we can see that there's an EditText element for the note content. Let's proceed with entering the note content:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 180), click, NULL): Click to focus on the note content area for editing
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 180), input, "Note2"): Enter "Note2" as the body content of the new note
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in the source test case. We're clicking on the note content area first to ensure it's focused, then inputting the content "Note2".
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given actions:

```
d.click(0, 180)
d.send_keys("Note2")
```

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the note content area at coordinates (0, 180) to focus on it for editing.
2. Enters the text "Note2" as the body content of the new note.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL): Click the back button to return to the previous page, which is the main notes list page. The next page contains a ListView with id "me.writeily:id/notes_listview" displaying note titles and last modified dates, and a floating action button with id "me.writeily:id/fab_expand_menu_button".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), longClick, NULL): Long press on the "Go back" button to return to the previous page, which is the main page displaying a list of notes. The main page contains a ListView with id "me.writeily:id/notes_listview" showing multiple note entries, and a floating action button with id "me.writeily:id/fab_expand_menu_button" for creating new notes.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), click, "Title3"): Click to edit the note title. No new page appears, but the cursor is placed in the title field for editing.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (528, 72), click, NULL): Click to open the share options for the current note. This action opens a system share dialog or menu, which is not captured in the Next Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (528, 72), longClick, NULL): Long click on the share button to open sharing options. No new page appears, but a sharing menu or dialog may be displayed with various sharing options.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_preview, (624, 72), click, NULL): Click to preview the note content. The page transitions to a preview mode with a WebView displaying the formatted note content and an "Edit" button (id: me.writeily:id/action_edit) replacing the "Preview" button.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_preview, (624, 72), longClick, NULL): Long click on the preview button to potentially trigger additional options or actions related to previewing the note. However, no new page or dialog appears based on the Next Page JSON, suggesting this action might not have a visible effect in the current implementation.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 180), click, "Note2"): Click to edit the note content. The page remains the same after clicking, allowing the user to input or modify the note text.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 180), longClick, "Note2"): Long click on the note content to open a text selection menu with options for translating, cutting, copying, pasting, and sharing the selected text. The menu appears with id "android:id/floating_toolbar_menu_item_text" for each option.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I can determine that we have successfully completed steps 1 through 3 of the source test case. The next step in the source test case is to save and exit the note editing screen. Let's proceed with this step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL): Click the back button to return to the previous page, which is the main notes list page
~~~

This action corresponds to step 4 in the source test case, where we click on the back button to save and exit the note editing screen. The target app seems to use a different approach for this action, using a back button instead of a specific toolbar edit button. However, the functionality remains the same - to save and exit the note editing screen.
Based on the provided action and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(0, 64)
···

This code clicks on the back button located at coordinates (0, 64) to return to the previous page, which is the main notes list page. Since precise coordinates are provided, we use them directly in the `click()` method of the UIAutomator2 device object `d`.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I will proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Here's my analysis and recommendation:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/note_title, (160, 596), matches(withText("Title3"))):Verify that the newly created note with title "Title3" is displayed in the main notes list
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/note_extra, (160, 648), matches(containsString("Note2"))):Verify that the newly created note's content "Note2" is partially visible in the main notes list
~~~

Explanation:
1. We have successfully completed steps 1-5 of the source test case, which involve creating a new note with the title "Title3" and content "Note2".
2. The next step in the source test case (step 6) is to click on the newly created note to open it for editing. However, before we do that, it's important to verify that the note we just created is actually visible in the main notes list.
3. Therefore, I've added two assertions to check for the presence and correctness of the newly created note in the list:
   - The first assertion checks if a TextView with the text "Title3" exists, which corresponds to the title of our new note.
   - The second assertion checks if another TextView (likely the preview of the note content) contains the string "Note2", which is the content we added to the note.
4. These assertions will help ensure that the note creation process was successful and that the note is properly displayed in the main list before we proceed to open it for editing.

Next, we should proceed with opening the note for editing, which corresponds to step 6 in the source test case. Please provide the result of these assertions, and I'll then guide you through the next action to take.
Based on the provided actions, I'll convert them into UIAutomator2 code in Python. I'll use coordinates as the preferred method for interaction since they are provided and precise.

···
assert d(resourceId="me.writeily:id/note_title").get_text() == "Title3"
assert "Note2" in d(resourceId="me.writeily:id/note_extra").get_text()
···

Note: In this case, I've used the resourceId for the assertions instead of coordinates because the assertions are checking for text content, which is more reliably done using the element's resourceId. The coordinates provided are likely for the position of the elements on the screen, but for text verification, using the resourceId is more appropriate and reliable.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current state of the migration, it appears that we have successfully completed steps 1 through 5 of the source test case. The next step in the source test case is to open the newly created note for editing. Let's proceed with this step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/note_title, (160, 596), click, "Title3"): Click on the note titled "Title3" to open it for editing
~~~

This action corresponds to step 6 in the source test case: "Click on the note with the title "Title3" to open it for editing." We're using the TextView with the title "Title3" to open the note, which should bring us to the note editing screen.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d.click(160, 596)
```

This code uses the coordinates (160, 596) to click on the note titled "Title3". As per the requirements, coordinates are preferred when they are precise, which is the case here. This action will open the note for editing.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL): Click to return to the previous page, which is the main page listing all notes. The main page contains a ListView with id "me.writeily:id/notes_listview" showing note titles and last modified dates, and a floating action button with id "me.writeily:id/fab_expand_menu_button".
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), click, "Title3"): Click to edit the note title. Clicking on this control activates the text selection toolbar with options for "粘贴" (Paste), "全选" (Select All), and "选择" (Select).
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), long_click, "Title3"): Long click on the note title to open a context menu with options for text manipulation, including translate, cut, copy, paste, and share. The menu appears with buttons for these actions and an overflow menu for additional options.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (528, 72), click, NULL): Click to share the current note. This action opens the system's share menu, allowing the user to choose how to share the note content.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (528, 72), longClick, NULL): Long click to open sharing options for the current note. No new page appears, but a sharing menu or dialog is likely to be displayed with various sharing options.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_preview, (624, 72), click, NULL): Click to preview the current note. The page switches to a preview mode with a WebView displaying the formatted note content and an "Edit" button replacing the "Preview" button.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_preview, (624, 72), long_click, NULL): Long click on the preview button to potentially open a context menu or perform an extended preview action. No new page or dialog appears, as the JSON for the next page is identical to the current page.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 180), click, "Note2\n"): Click to edit the note content. This action does not navigate to a new page but allows the user to modify the existing note text.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 180), long_click, "Note2\n"): Long click on the note content to open a text selection menu with options for translation, cut, copy, paste, and share. The menu appears as a floating toolbar with clickable items.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Here's my response:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), click, NULL):Click to focus on the note title field for editing
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), input, "Title2"):Change the title of the note from "Title3" to "Title2"
~~~

Explanation:
1. We are currently at step 7 of the source test case, which involves changing the title of the note from "Title3" to "Title2".
2. The executed action sequence shows that we have successfully opened the note for editing.
3. The current page's intent description provides us with the necessary information about the edit_note_title EditText field.
4. We first need to click on the title field to focus it, then input the new title "Title2".
5. This matches the functionality of the source test case while adapting to the specific UI elements and actions available in the target app.
Based on the provided information and requirements, I'll convert the actions into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the code wrapped in triple backticks:

```
d.click(144, 64)
d.send_keys("Title2")
```

This code does the following:
1. Clicks on the coordinates (144, 64) to focus on the note title field.
2. Sends the keys "Title2" to change the title of the note from "Title3" to "Title2".

I've used the coordinate-based approach as per the recommendation, and the device variable name 'd' as specified in the input.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, here's the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL): Click the back button to return to the previous page, which displays a list of notes including "Title2" and "Title1" with their last modified dates.
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've successfully completed steps 1-7 of the source test case.
2. The next step in the source test case (step 8) is to navigate back to the main screen.
3. In the current page's intent description, we have an action that matches this requirement: clicking the back button to return to the previous page (which is the main notes list).
4. This action aligns with the RETURN operation in the source test case, so we can use it to complete this step of the migration.

After executing this action, we should be back on the main screen with the list of notes, where we can proceed with the final assertions in the source test case.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(0, 64)
···

This code uses the coordinates (0, 64) to click the back button, as specified in the action description. Since coordinates are provided and they are precise, we use them directly in the `click()` method of the device object `d`.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully migrated the first 8 steps of the source test case. Now, we need to verify the changes made to the note. Let's proceed with the next step:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/note_title, (160, 278), matches(withText("Title2"))):Verify that the note title "Title2" is displayed on the main screen.
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/note_extra, (160, 330), matches(containsString("Note2"))):Verify that the note body "Note2" is partially visible on the main screen.
DONE
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've used the `ASSERT` action to verify that the note title "Title2" is displayed on the main screen. This corresponds to step 9 in the source test case.
2. We've also used another `ASSERT` action to verify that the note body "Note2" is partially visible on the main screen. This corresponds to step 10 in the source test case.
3. Since we have now migrated all steps from the source test case to the target app, we can conclude the migration process with `DONE`.

These assertions match the functionality of the original test case while adapting to the specific elements and IDs of the target application. The coordinates provided are based on the current page's intent description for the respective elements.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

```
assert d(resourceId="me.writeily:id/note_title", className="android.widget.TextView").get_text() == "Title2"
assert "Note2" in d(resourceId="me.writeily:id/note_extra", className="android.widget.TextView").get_text()
```

This code performs the following actions:

1. Asserts that the text of the TextView with the resource ID "me.writeily:id/note_title" is exactly "Title2".
2. Asserts that the text of the TextView with the resource ID "me.writeily:id/note_extra" contains the string "Note2".

Note that while coordinates were provided, I used the resource IDs for more reliable element identification, as per the guidelines when precise coordinates are not essential for the operation.
