#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with creating a new note, so we should look for a similar action in the target application. Let's proceed with the first step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/newNote, (530, 1410), click, NULL): Click to create a new note
~~~

This action corresponds to the first two steps in the source test case (clicking the floating action button and then the create note button). In the target app, we can directly create a new note with a single click on the newNote button.
Based on the provided information, I'll convert the action into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the code:

···
d.click(530, 1410)
···

This code uses the coordinates (530, 1410) to click on the ImageButton for creating a new note. I've used the coordinate-based approach as it's the preferred method according to the requirements, and the coordinates are precise in this case.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL): Click the back button to return to the previous page. This action triggers a dialog asking "Save changes?" with options "NO" (id: android:id/button2) and "YES" (id: android:id/button1).
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), long_click, NULL): Long click on the back button to show a confirmation dialog asking "Save changes?" with "YES" and "NO" options.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/action_note_colour, (544, 72), click, NULL): Click to open the note colour selection dialog. The dialog appears with title "Change note colour" and includes a 3x3 grid of colour options represented by clickable FrameLayout elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/action_note_colour, (592.0, 120.0), longClick, NULL): Long click to open color selection options for the note. No new page appears, but a color picker dialog or menu is likely to show up, allowing the user to choose a new color for the note.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (640, 72), click, NULL): Open options menu containing "Note font size" and "Hide note body in list" settings.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (680.0, 120.0), longClick, NULL): Long click on "More options" to open additional menu options. The action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleEdit, (0, 176), click, "Title"): Click to edit the title of the note. The page remains the same with the title edit field active for input.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleEdit, (360.0, 226.0), long_click, "Title"): Long click on the title edit field to select text or bring up text editing options. The page remains the same after this action, with no new elements appearing.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyEdit, (0, 292), click, "Note"): Click to edit the note content. This action focuses on the note body input field, allowing the user to enter or modify the note text.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyEdit, (360.0, 316.5), long_click, "Note"): Long press on the note body to bring up a context menu with a "Paste" option, allowing users to paste content into the note.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case has been completed, which is creating a new note. Now, we need to proceed with entering the note title. Here's the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleEdit, (0, 176), input, "note"): Input the title "note" for the new note
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in the source test case, where we input the title "note" for the new note. The target app seems to have a similar structure with a separate field for the note title, so we can directly migrate this step.
Based on the given action and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to input the title "note" for the new note:

···
d.click(0, 176)
d.send_keys("note")
···

This code first clicks on the EditText field at the coordinates (0, 176), and then sends the keys "note" to input the title. I've used the coordinates as specified in the action description, which is the preferred method according to the requirements.

ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL): Click to navigate back, prompting a "Save changes?" dialog with options "NO" (id: android:id/button2) and "YES" (id: android:id/button1).
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), longClick, NULL): Long-press on the back button to trigger a dialog asking "Save changes?". The dialog contains two buttons: "NO" (id: android:id/button2) and "YES" (id: android:id/button1).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/action_note_colour, (544, 72), click, NULL): Click to open the note color selection dialog. The dialog shows a title "Change note colour" and a grid of color options represented by clickable FrameLayout elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/action_note_colour, (592.0, 120.0), longClick, NULL): Long press on the note colour button to access additional colour options. No new page or dialog appears, but the action might trigger a color picker or change the note's color directly.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (640, 72), click, NULL): Click on the "More options" button to open a menu with additional options. The menu includes "Note font size" and "Hide note body in list" options.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (680.0, 120.0), long_click, NULL): Long click on the "更多选项" (More options) button to open additional options. This action does not navigate to a new page, but it likely triggers a popup menu or dialog with additional actions for the note, such as sharing, deleting, or accessing settings.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleEdit, (0, 176), click, "note"): Click to edit the note title. No new page or dialog appears, but the keyboard may be activated for text input.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleEdit, (360.0, 226.0), longClick, "note"): Long click on the title edit field to open a context menu with options including translate, cut, copy, paste, and share. The context menu appears with buttons for these actions, including a "More options" button with id "android:id/overflow".

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll continue with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyEdit, (0, 292), input, "something"): Input the content "something" for the new note
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already completed steps 1-3 of the source test case (creating a new note and inputting the title).
2. The next logical step is to input content into the note body, which corresponds to step 4 in the source test case.
3. From the current page's intent description, we can see that there's an EditText widget with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyEdit" which is used for editing the note body.
4. We'll use this widget to input the content "something" as specified in the source test case.

This action aligns with the source test case's step 4, maintaining the functional similarity while adapting to the specific widget IDs and layout of the target app.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(0, 292)
d.send_keys("something")
···

This code performs the following steps:
1. Clicks on the EditText field at the coordinates (0, 292).
2. Inputs the text "something" into the field.

I've used the coordinates as preferred in the requirements, and followed the instruction to set text to an input box by first clicking on the coordinates and then using send_keys() to input the content.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I can determine that we are currently at step 5 of the source test case, which involves previewing the note. However, the target app (SwiftNotes) doesn't seem to have a direct preview function like the source app (Writeily). Instead, we'll need to adapt our approach. Let's proceed with the next logical step in the migration process:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL):Click the back button to attempt to return to the main screen, which should trigger a save prompt
~~~

This action corresponds to step 6 in the source test case, where we navigate back. In the target app, this action serves a dual purpose: it attempts to go back and should prompt to save the note, which indirectly confirms that the note creation was successful.
Based on the provided action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the requested action:

···
d.click(0, 64)
···

This code will click on the back button located at the coordinates (0, 64) using the device variable 'd'. This action should trigger a save prompt as described in the purpose of the action.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (50, 758), click, "Save changes?"): Click on the message to read the confirmation dialog. The dialog remains open with "NO" and "YES" buttons (ids: android:id/button2 and android:id/button1) available for user response.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (360.0, 779.5), longClick, "Save changes?"): Long click on the message to possibly copy or select the text. No new page or dialog appears, but the text might be highlighted or a context menu might pop up (not visible in the provided JSON).
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (390, 826), click, "NO"): Click the "NO" button to discard changes and return to the main note list. The next page shows the main Swiftnotes interface with a list of existing notes, a search action, and a "New note" button.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (454.0, 880.0), click, "NO"): Click the "NO" button to discard changes and return to the main notes list. The next page shows the main Swiftnotes screen with a list of existing notes, a search button with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/action_search", and a "New note" button with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/newNote".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (518, 826), click, "YES"): Click to save changes to the note. After saving, the app returns to the main note list page, which displays a ListView with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/listView" containing the saved notes, including the newly edited note with title "note" and content "something".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (582.0, 880.0), click, "YES"): Click to confirm saving changes. The page after clicking this button returns to the main note list page, which contains a ListView with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/listView" displaying saved notes, and a "New note" button with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/newNote".

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I can determine that we are currently at the step where we need to save the newly created note. The source test case has completed steps 1-4, which involve creating a new note and inputting its title and content. The executed action sequence shows that these steps have been successfully performed in the target app as well.

Now, we are at a point where the app is asking whether to save the changes. This corresponds to the transition between steps 4 and 5 in the source test case. In the source app, this transition might have been automatic, but in the target app, we need to explicitly save the note.

Given the current page's intent description, the appropriate next action would be to save the changes by clicking the "YES" button. Here's the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (518, 826), click, NULL):Click to save changes to the note
~~~

This action will save the note and return to the main note list, which aligns with the flow of the source test case. After this action, we should be ready to proceed with the next step in the source test case, which is to preview the note.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(518, 826)
···

This code uses the coordinates (518, 826) to click the button, which is the preferred method as per the requirements. The click action is performed using the device variable 'd' as specified in the device variable name.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView, (52, 202), matches, "note"): Verify that the note title is displayed as "note" and is visible on the main screen
~~~

This assertion corresponds to step 7 in the source test case, where we verify that the newly created note appears in the list with the correct title. The coordinates and element ID have been adjusted to match the target app's layout as described in the current page's intent description.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
assert d(resourceId="com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView", text="note").exists()
```

This code asserts that a TextView with the specified resource ID and text "note" exists on the screen. This approach combines the use of the resource ID and text attribute, which should provide a reliable way to verify the presence of the note title.

However, if you prefer to use coordinates as the primary method of interaction, we can modify the code to use the click coordinates followed by a text verification:

```
d.click(52, 202)
assert d(resourceId="com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView").get_text() == "note"
```

This version clicks on the specified coordinates (52, 202) and then verifies that the text of the element with the given resource ID matches "note".

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated most of the steps from the source test case to the target application. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next action:

1. We've created a new note, input the title and content, saved it, and verified its presence on the main screen.
2. The source test case included a step to preview the note, which we haven't done yet.
3. The current page's intentions don't explicitly mention a preview function, so we might need to explore alternatives or skip this step.

Given these considerations, here's the next action I propose:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (640, 72), click, NULL): Open options menu to check for a preview option or similar functionality
~~~

This action aims to open the options menu to see if there's a preview function or something similar that we can use to complete the migration of step 5 from the source test case. If we don't find a preview option, we may need to consider this step as not applicable in the target app and move on to complete the test case migration.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code for the given action:

···
d.click(640, 72)
···

This code uses the coordinates (640, 72) to click on the ImageView element, which should open the options menu to check for a preview option or similar functionality. I've used the device variable name 'd' as specified in the input, and opted for the coordinate-based interaction as it's the preferred method when precise coordinates are available.

ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (320, 72), click, NULL): Click on the "Note font size" option in the settings menu. This action does not navigate to a new page, but may open a submenu or dialog to adjust the font size.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (320, 72), longClick, NULL): Long click to open the note settings menu. A dialog appears with options to change note font size, including "Small", "Medium", and "Large" text sizes, and a "Cancel" button.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/title, (352, 98), click, "Note font size"): Click to open the font size selection dialog. The next page shows a dialog with title "Change note font size" and options "Small", "Medium", "Large" for selecting font size.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/title, (516.0, 119.5), longClick, "Note font size"): Long click on "Note font size" option to open a dialog for changing note font size. The dialog contains options for "Small", "Medium", and "Large" font sizes with IDs "android:id/text1", and a "Cancel" button with ID "android:id/button3".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/title, (516.0, 98), longClick, "Note font size"): Long click on "Note font size" option to open additional settings. This action returns to the previous page with the note editor containing titleEdit (id: com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleEdit) and bodyEdit (id: com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyEdit) fields.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated most of the steps from the source test case to the target application. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next action:

1. We've created a new note, input the title and content, saved it, and verified its presence on the main screen.
2. The last action was opening the options menu, likely to look for a preview functionality.

However, we haven't yet found a direct equivalent to the "preview" action from the source test case. Given that the current page's intentions are related to font size settings, it seems we might be in a different part of the application.

At this point, we should try to find a way to view or interact with the created note, which could be similar to the "preview" functionality in the source app. Here's what I suggest:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView, (52, 202), click, NULL): Click on the created note to open it for viewing or editing, which may serve as an equivalent to the preview functionality in the source app
~~~

This action attempts to open the note we just created, which could provide a view similar to the preview in the source application. If this action is successful, we can then verify the note's content and potentially complete the test case migration.
Based on the provided action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d.click(52, 202)
···

This code uses the coordinates (52, 202) to click on the created note, which should open it for viewing or editing. This action is equivalent to clicking on the note's title view and serves as a way to preview or edit the note, similar to the functionality in the source app.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleEdit, (0, 176), matches, "note"): Verify that the note title is displayed as "note" in the edit view
ASSERT (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyEdit, (0, 292), matches, "something"): Verify that the note content is displayed as "something" in the edit view
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL): Click the back button to return to the main notes list page
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already created a new note, input the title and content, saved it, and opened it for viewing/editing.
2. The next logical step is to verify the content in the edit view, which serves as an equivalent to the preview functionality in the source app.
3. After verification, we return to the main notes list page using the back button.

This migration step combines the preview functionality (step 5 in the source test case) with the verification step (step 7 in the source test case), adapting to the different UI and functionality of the target app.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given actions:

```
assert d(resourceId="com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleEdit").get_text() == "note"
assert d(resourceId="com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyEdit").get_text() == "something"
d.click(0, 64)
```

This code performs the following actions:
1. Asserts that the note title edit field contains the text "note".
2. Asserts that the note content edit field contains the text "something".
3. Clicks on the back button at coordinates (0, 64) to return to the main notes list page.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated most of the steps from the source test case to the target application. Let's review the progress and determine the next action:

1. We've created a new note with the title "note" and content "something".
2. We've verified the note's presence in the main list.
3. We've opened the note to view its contents, which serves as an equivalent to the preview functionality in the source app.
4. We've verified the note's title and content in the edit view.
5. We've returned to the main notes list page.

The only step from the source test case that we haven't explicitly addressed is step 7, which verifies the note title on the main screen after returning from the preview/edit view. Let's perform this final verification:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView, (52, 202), matches, "note"): Verify that the note title is still displayed as "note" on the main screen after returning from the edit view.
DONE
~~~

This final assertion checks that the note title is still correctly displayed on the main screen after we've viewed and edited the note, which completes the migration of all steps from the source test case to the target application. The DONE statement indicates that we have successfully matched and migrated all steps of the source test case to the target app.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given assertion:

···
assert d(resourceId="com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleView", className="android.widget.TextView").get_text() == "note"
···

This code checks if the text of the specified TextView element matches "note". I've used the resourceId and className as they are provided and unique, which is generally more reliable than coordinates for assertions. However, if you strictly prefer coordinates, you can use this alternative:

···
assert d(className="android.widget.TextView").get_text(52, 202) == "note"
···

Both versions accomplish the same task of verifying that the note title is still displayed as "note" on the main screen after returning from the edit view.
