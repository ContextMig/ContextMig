## n3's Test8 to n2

### Semantics of Source Test case
> Based on the provided Android test case, here's the corresponding function description following the specified format:
> 
> ```
> This test case is testing the functionality of deleting a note within a folder and verifying the empty state of the folder afterwards.
> 
> The detailed process with serial numbers is as follows:
> 
> 1. ACTION (TextView, R.id.note_title, (), click, NULL): Click on the folder named "folder1" to open it.
> 
> 2. ACTION (TextView, R.id.note_title, (), long_click, NULL): Long-click on the note titled "note1" to select it.
> 
> 3. ACTION (MenuItem, R.id.context_menu_delete, (), click, NULL): Click on the delete option in the context menu.
> 
> 4. ACTION (Button, android.R.id.button1, (), click, NULL): Click on the "OK" button to confirm the deletion.
> 
> 5. ASSERT (TextView, R.id.empty_hint, (), matches, "This directory is empty"): Verify that the empty state message "This directory is empty" is displayed, indicating that the note has been successfully deleted and the folder is now empty.
> ```
> 
> This test case checks the deletion process of a note within a folder and ensures that the empty state is correctly displayed after the deletion.

````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (32, 93), click, "Swiftnotes"): Click on the Swiftnotes title. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the Current Page JSON and Next Page JSON are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (127.5, 120.0), long_click, "Swiftnotes"): Long click on the Swiftnotes title to perform an action. The page after this action remains the same, but the x-coordinate of some elements has changed from 127.5 to 32, possibly indicating a slight shift in the layout or the appearance of a context menu.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to open a folder named "folder1". However, in the target application (Swiftnotes), there doesn't seem to be a direct equivalent for folders. Instead, we'll focus on selecting a note, which is the closest match to the intention of the source test case.

Let's start with selecting a note from the list:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/listView, (0, 176), click, NULL):Click on the list view to select a note
~~~

This action will select a note from the list, which is the closest equivalent to opening a folder in the source application. We'll need to confirm if this action was successful before proceeding to the next step.
Based on the provided action description, I'll convert it into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Since coordinates are provided and they are the preferred method, I'll use them for the click action.

···
d.click(0, 176)
···

This code will perform a click action at the coordinates (0, 176) on the device screen, which corresponds to clicking on the list view to select a note as described in the action.

Based on the provided information, it appears we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to open a folder named "folder1". However, in the target application (Swiftnotes), there doesn't seem to be a direct folder structure visible on the current page. Instead, we have a list of notes.

Given that the ultimate goal is to delete a note and verify the empty state, we can proceed with selecting a note from the list view, which has already been done in the executed action sequence.

The next logical step would be to delete this selected note. In the source test case, this was done through a long-click to bring up a context menu. Let's try to replicate this in the target app:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/listView, (360, 888), longClick, NULL):Long click on the list view to activate multi-selection mode and bring up delete option
~~~

This action should bring up the selection mode, which includes a delete option based on the intent description provided.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d.long_click(360, 888, 1)
```

This code performs a long click action at the specified coordinates (360, 888) on the ListView element. The long click duration is set to 1 second, which is the standard duration for a long click in UIAutomator2.

Based on the provided information, it appears we are currently at step 2 of the source test case, which involves long-clicking on a note to select it. The executed action sequence shows that we have successfully performed this step in the target app. Now, we need to proceed with the next step, which is deleting the selected note. Let's formulate the appropriate action based on the current page's intentions:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/action_delete, (544, 72), click, NULL):Click on the delete option to remove the selected note
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in the source test case, where we click on the delete option in the context menu. In the target app, the delete option appears as a TextView with the id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/action_delete" after long-clicking to select a note.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(544, 72)
···

This code uses the coordinates (544, 72) to click on the delete option, as specified in the action description. Since coordinates are provided and are the preferred method according to the requirements, we use them directly in the `click()` function.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently at step 4 of the source test case, which involves confirming the deletion of the note. Let's proceed with the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/empty_message, (360, 640), matches, "No notes"): Verify that the empty state message "No notes" is displayed, indicating that the note has been successfully deleted and the folder is now empty.
~~~

This assertion checks for the presence of an empty state message, which is similar to step 5 in the source test case. The exact wording might be different ("No notes" instead of "This directory is empty"), but the purpose is the same - to confirm that the deletion was successful and the list is now empty.

If this assertion passes, we can consider the test case migration complete. However, if it fails, we may need to explore other options or adjust our approach.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the assertion:

```
assert d(resourceId="com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/empty_message", text="No notes").exists()
```

This code checks if the TextView with the specified resource ID and text "No notes" exists on the screen, verifying that the empty state message is displayed after the note deletion.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated the main steps of the source test case to the target application. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've clicked on a note (equivalent to opening a folder in the source app).
2. We've long-clicked on a note to select it.
3. We've clicked on the delete option.
4. We've verified that the empty state message is displayed after deletion.

These steps correspond closely to the steps in the source test case. The main difference is that we didn't need to confirm the deletion with an "OK" button in the target app.

Given that we've completed the main steps and verified the empty state, it seems we have successfully migrated the test case. However, to be thorough, let's double-check if there's anything else we need to verify or if we can conclude the test case migration.

Thank you for providing the device variable name and the instructions. I understand that the device variable name is 'd' and that you prefer using coordinates for operations when available. I'm ready to assist you with converting test semantic descriptions into UIAutomator2 code in Python. However, you haven't provided any specific actions to convert yet. The "DONE" message suggests that there are no actions to process at this time.

If you have any specific actions or assertions you'd like me to convert into UIAutomator2 code, please provide them in the format you described earlier:

ACTION (element, id, coordinates, action, value):purpose
or
ASSERT (element, id, coordinates, oracle):purpose

Once you provide these actions or assertions, I'll be happy to convert them into the appropriate UIAutomator2 code, wrapped in '···' as requested.
