#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to open the main view. Let's match this with an appropriate action in the target app.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/action_bar_title, (96, 87), click, "Note Now"):Click on the "Note Now" title to open the main view
~~~

This action should open the main view of the app, which aligns with the first step of the source test case. The next step would be to verify if this action was successful and then proceed with the subsequent steps of the test case.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d.click(96, 87)
```

This code uses the coordinates (96, 87) to perform a click action on the "Note Now" title, which should open the main view. I've used the coordinate-based approach as it's the preferred method according to the requirements.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Here's my analysis and recommendation:

1. The source test case starts with opening the main view, which has already been accomplished in the executed action sequence.

2. The next step in the source test case is to click on the third item in the main list view.

3. From the current page's intent description, we can see that there's a ListView with id "com.iliakplv.notes:id/notes_list" which contains the list of notes.

4. Although we don't have specific information about the third item, we can assume it exists in the list and proceed with clicking on it.

Based on this analysis, here's the next action to perform:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, com.iliakplv.notes:id/notes_list, (8, 168), click, NULL):Click on the third item in the notes list to open it
~~~

This action attempts to click on the third item in the notes list, which corresponds to step 2 in the source test case. The exact coordinates might need adjustment to target the third item specifically, but this action should move us forward in the migration process.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

Â·Â·Â·
d.click(8, 168)
Â·Â·Â·

This code uses the coordinates (8, 168) to click on the third item in the notes list. As per the requirements, using coordinates is the preferred method when they are provided precisely, which is the case here.

Based on the provided information, we are currently at step 2 of the source test case. The next step in the source test case is to delete all items in the trash. However, the current page's intentions don't show any direct option for deleting all items or accessing the trash. Let's try to navigate to a menu that might contain these options.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (608, 64), click, NULL):Click to open the menu with additional options
~~~
I understand. I'll convert the given action into UIAutomator2 code using Python, with the device variable name 'd'. I'll prioritize using coordinates as requested. Here's the converted code:

```
d.click(608, 64)
```

This code will click on the ImageButton at the coordinates (608, 64) to open the menu with additional options. I've used the coordinates provided in the action description, as that's the preferred method according to your instructions.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently at step 3 of the source test case, which involves deleting all items in the trash. However, the current page's intentions and the executed actions don't directly align with this step. Let's try to find the closest match to proceed with the test case migration.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (344, 183), click, "Sort"):Opens a submenu with sorting options for notes, including "By title", "By creation (oldest first)", "By creation (newest first)", and "By last changing".
~~~

Explanation: 
Since we don't see a direct "Delete All" or "Trash" option in the current page's intentions, we'll try to navigate through the available options to find a way to access the trash or delete functionality. The "Sort" option might lead us to a view where we can find more options, potentially including access to the trash or delete functionality.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code for the given action:

Â·Â·Â·
d.click(344, 183)
Â·Â·Â·

This code clicks on the "Sort" option using the provided coordinates (344, 183). This action will open the submenu with sorting options for notes, as described in the input.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (270, 205), click, "Sort"): Click to access the sorting options. The page remains the same, showing sorting options including "By title", "By creation (oldest first)", "By creation (newest first)", and "By last changing".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (270, 205), longClick, "Sort"): Long click on the "Sort" title. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger new widgets to appear.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (238, 274), click, NULL): Click to select the "By title" sorting option. This action does not navigate to a new page, but may apply the sorting to the list on the previous page.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (238, 274), longClick, NULL): Long click on the "By title" sorting option. This action returns to the main notes list page, which includes a ListView with id "com.iliakplv.notes:id/notes_list" containing multiple note items.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently at step 3 of the source test case, where we need to delete all items in the trash. However, the current page's intentions and the executed action sequence suggest that we are in a sorting menu instead of the trash view. This indicates that we need to navigate back to the main view and then find a way to access the trash.

Let's proceed with the following action:

~~~
RETURN:Return to the main notes list to find a way to access the trash
~~~

This action will take us back to the main notes list, where we can look for options to access the trash and continue with the test case migration.
I understand. Based on the given action, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to return to the main notes list:

Â·Â·Â·
d.press('back')
Â·Â·Â·

This code uses the device variable 'd' as specified and performs a back operation, which should return to the main notes list. The back operation is a common way to navigate backwards in Android applications, and it's likely to be the most straightforward way to return to the main notes list from wherever the current position is in the app.

Based on the executed actions and the current page's intentions, it seems we've deviated from the original test case. The source test case is about deleting all items in the trash, but we haven't accessed the trash yet. Let's try to find a way to access the trash or delete notes. Here's the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (608, 64), click, NULL):Click to open the menu with additional options to find a way to access trash or delete notes
~~~
Based on the given action description, I'll convert it to UIAutomator2 code in Python. Since coordinates are provided and are the preferred method, I'll use them for the click action.

Â·Â·Â·
d.click(608, 64)
Â·Â·Â·

This code will click on the ImageButton at the coordinates (608, 64) to open the menu with additional options, which should lead to accessing trash or deleting notes functionality.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently trying to find a way to access the trash or delete notes in the target application. Let's proceed with the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (344, 379), click, "Settings"):Click on "Settings" to open the Settings page and look for trash-related options
~~~

This action is chosen because:
1. We've already explored the "Sort" option, which didn't lead us to the trash functionality.
2. The "Settings" option is often where trash or deletion-related settings can be found in note-taking apps.
3. We need to find a way to access the trash or delete notes to continue with the test case migration.

If this action is successful, we'll be able to explore the Settings page for trash-related options. If not, we'll need to explore other available options to find the trash functionality.
Based on the provided information, I'll convert the action into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the generated code:

Â·Â·Â·
d.click(344, 379)
Â·Â·Â·

I've used the coordinates (344, 379) as the primary method to perform the click action, as per the recommendation to prefer coordinates when they are precise. This action will click on the "Settings" option to open the Settings page.

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we are now in the Settings page of the target application. However, the source test case is focused on deleting items from the trash, which we haven't accessed yet. Let's try to find a way to access the trash or delete notes from the main screen.

~~~
RETURN:Return to the main notes list to find a way to access the trash or delete notes
~~~
Based on the given action, here's the UIAutomator2 code to return to the main notes list:

Â·Â·Â·
d.press('back')
Â·Â·Â·

This code uses the device variable 'd' as specified and performs a back operation, which should return the user to the main notes list. This action is typically used to navigate back in Android applications, and it's the most straightforward way to return to a previous screen or the main list view in most note-taking apps.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the executed actions and the current page's intent description, it appears that we are still in the process of finding a way to access the trash or delete notes. The source test case is focused on deleting all items in the trash, but we haven't found a direct way to access the trash yet. Let's continue exploring the available options to find a way to delete notes or access the trash.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.iliakplv.notes:id/label_name, (24, 184), click, "All notes"):Click on "All notes" to return to the main notes list view and explore other options for accessing trash or deleting notes
~~~

This action will close the navigation drawer and return us to the main notes list. From there, we can explore other options to find a way to delete notes or access the trash, which is necessary to proceed with the test case migration.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d.click(24, 184)
```

This code uses the coordinates (24, 184) to click on the "All notes" TextView, which should return the user to the main notes list view. This approach aligns with the recommendation to prefer using coordinates when they are precise.
