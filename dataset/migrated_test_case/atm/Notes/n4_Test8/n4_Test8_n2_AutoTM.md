#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with opening the main view of the app. Let's begin with the first step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (32, 93), click, "Swiftnotes"):Click on the app title to open the main view
~~~

This action corresponds to the first step in the source test case, which is to open the main view. Clicking on the app title "Swiftnotes" should refresh or return to the main screen, which is equivalent to opening the main view in the source app.
I understand. I'll convert the given action into UIAutomator2 code using Python, with the device variable name as 'd'. I'll prioritize using coordinates as specified. Here's the converted code:

```
d.click(32, 93)
```

This code will click on the coordinates (32, 93), which corresponds to the app title "Swiftnotes" as described in the action. The click operation will open the main view of the app.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to open the main view, which has already been executed successfully in the target app. Let's proceed with the next step.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/listView, (0, 176), click, NULL):Click on the third item (index 2) in the main list view to select a note
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 in the source test case. We're selecting an item from the list view, which should be similar in functionality to the source app. The exact index (third item) isn't specified in the target app's intentions, so we're using the general click action on the list view. The next step would depend on the result of this action.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d.click(0, 176)
```

This code uses the coordinates provided (0, 176) to click on the third item in the main list view. As per the requirements, we prefer using coordinates when they are precise, which is the case here. This action will select the note at index 2 in the ListView.

Based on the provided information, we are currently at step 3 of the source test case. The first two steps have been successfully executed in the target app. Let's proceed with the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (640, 72), click, NULL):Click on the options menu to access delete functionality
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in the source test case, where we need to access the delete functionality. In the target app, it appears that we need to open the options menu first to potentially access the delete option. This slight difference in UI structure is common when migrating between different apps of the same category.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(640, 72)
···

This code clicks on the options menu at the specified coordinates (640, 72) to access the delete functionality. Since precise coordinates are provided, they are used as the preferred method for interaction.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently at step 3 of the source test case, which involves deleting all items in the trash. However, the current page's intent description doesn't show any direct option for deleting all notes or accessing the trash. Let's try to find the closest matching action that could lead us to the delete functionality.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/title, (352, 98), click, "Backup notes"):Click to open the backup notes dialog, which might lead to more options including delete
~~~

This action is chosen because:
1. We've already clicked on the options menu in the previous step.
2. There's no direct "Delete All" or "Trash" option visible in the current intentions.
3. Accessing the backup functionality might reveal more options or lead to a page where we can manage notes, potentially including deletion.

If this action doesn't lead to the desired delete functionality, we may need to explore other options or consider that the delete all functionality might be implemented differently in this app compared to the source app.
Understood. Based on the provided information and the action description, I'll convert it to UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the translation:

```
d.click(352, 98)
```

This code clicks on the specified coordinates (352, 98) which corresponds to the "Backup notes" TextView. This action should open the backup notes dialog as described.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (98, 705), click, "Backup notes"): Clicking on the alert title does not change the page or trigger any new elements. The alert dialog with options to backup notes remains visible, containing "NO" and "YES" buttons with IDs "android:id/button2" and "android:id/button1" respectively.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (98, 705), long_click, "Backup notes"): Long click on the alert title. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new elements, as the Current Page JSON and Next Page JSON are identical.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (50, 775), longClick, "Are you sure you want to backup current notes?"): Long click on the confirmation message. This action does not navigate to a new page or generate new widgets, as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (390, 879), click, "NO"): Click the "NO" button to cancel the backup operation and return to the main notes list page, which contains a ListView with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/listView" displaying note items, and a "New note" button with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/newNote".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (390, 879), longClick, "NO"): Long click on the "NO" button to cancel the backup notes operation. The app returns to the main notes list view, which includes a search action with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/action_search", a list view of notes with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/listView", and a new note button with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/newNote".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (518, 879), click, "YES"): Click the "YES" button to confirm the backup of current notes. After clicking, a new dialog appears with a success message, showing the backup location, and an "OK" button with id "android:id/button3".

Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently at a different point in the application flow compared to the source test case. The source test case is focused on deleting all items in the trash, while the current state of the target application shows a dialog for backing up notes. However, we can try to continue with the test case migration by finding the most appropriate next action. Here's my suggestion:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (390, 879), click, "NO"):Cancel the backup operation and return to the main notes list page to continue with the deletion process
~~~

Explanation:
1. We are currently in a backup notes dialog, which is not part of the original test case.
2. To get back on track with the deletion process, we need to return to the main notes list.
3. Clicking "NO" on the backup dialog should take us back to the main list view, where we can then look for delete options.
4. After this action, we should be able to proceed with finding a way to delete notes or access the trash, which aligns more closely with the source test case.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(390, 879)
···

This code clicks on the "NO" button at the specified coordinates (390, 879) to cancel the backup operation and return to the main notes list page. I've used the coordinates as they were provided and precise, which is the preferred method according to the requirements.

Based on the provided information, it seems we are in the process of migrating a test case for deleting all items in the trash and verifying the empty state. However, the executed actions so far don't directly correspond to this goal. Let's try to get back on track with the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (640, 72), click, NULL):Click on the options menu to access delete functionality
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/listView, (0, 176), longClick, NULL):Long click on a note in the list view to open a context menu with options to delete the selected note
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/action_delete, (544, 72), click, NULL):Click on the delete option to remove the selected note
~~~
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the given actions:

```
d.click(640, 72)
d.long_click(0, 176, 1)
d.click(544, 72)
```

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the options menu at coordinates (640, 72) to access delete functionality.
2. Long clicks on a note in the list view at coordinates (0, 176) to open a context menu with options to delete the selected note.
3. Clicks on the delete option at coordinates (544, 72) to remove the selected note.

ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL): Click on the collapse button to exit the search mode and return to the main note list view. The next page shows the full list of notes with favorite buttons and a "New note" button at the bottom.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/search_src_text, (128, 84), click, "Search"): Click to focus on the search input field. This action does not navigate to a new page but allows the user to enter search terms to filter the notes displayed in the listView below.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/search_src_text, (128, 84), longClick, "Search"): Long click on the search input field to open a context menu with a "Paste" option, allowing the user to paste text into the search field.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (640, 72), click, NULL): Open options menu, displaying items for Search, Backup notes, Restore notes, and Rate app.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (640, 72), longClick, NULL): Long click on the "更多选项" (More options) button to open a menu with additional options. No new page appears, but a popup menu likely shows up with various actions such as settings, about, or other app-specific options.
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/listView, (0, 176), click, NULL): Click on the list view to select a note. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the current and next page JSONs are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/listView, (0, 176), long_click, NULL): Long click on the list view to potentially select or perform actions on multiple notes. No new page or dialog appears, but the UI might change to show selection indicators or additional options for the selected items.
ACTION (android.widget.RelativeLayout, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/relativeLayout, (32, 192), click, NULL): Click on the note item to view or edit its content. The page after clicking remains the same, suggesting that this action might open the note content in a new activity or dialog not captured in the provided JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.RelativeLayout, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/relativeLayout, (32, 192), longClick, NULL): Long click on the note item to open the note editing page. The new page contains a title input field with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleEdit" and a body input field with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyEdit".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyView, (52, 285), click, "*-_#!:>()"): Click on the note body to open the note editing page. The new page contains a title field with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/titleEdit" and a body editing field with id "com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyEdit".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyView, (52, 285), longClick, "*-_#!:>()"): Long click on the note body to open the note editing page.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently at the step of deleting notes in the target application. The source test case aims to delete all items in the trash, but the target app seems to have a different structure where notes are deleted directly from the main list. Let's proceed with the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/listView, (0, 176), longClick, NULL):Long click on another note in the list view to select it for deletion
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/action_delete, (544, 72), click, NULL):Click on the delete option to remove the selected note
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyView, (52, 285), !exists):Verify that the deleted note no longer exists in the list view
~~~

This step continues the process of deleting notes from the main list, which seems to be the equivalent of emptying the trash in the source application. We're selecting and deleting another note, then verifying its removal. This approach allows us to gradually remove all notes, mimicking the "delete all" functionality of the source app.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

```
d.long_click(0, 176, 1)
d.click(544, 72)
assert not d(resourceId="com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/bodyView").exists()
```

This code does the following:

1. Performs a long click on the specified coordinates (0, 176) for 1 second to select a note for deletion.
2. Clicks on the delete option at coordinates (544, 72).
3. Asserts that the deleted note (identified by its resourceId) no longer exists in the list view.

The code uses coordinates as the preferred method of interaction, as specified in the requirements. It also includes the necessary assertion to verify the deletion of the note.

Based on the provided information, I'll continue with the test case migration. The next step should focus on verifying the empty state of the notes list, which corresponds to step 5 in the source test case.

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/empty, (0, 640), matches, "No notes to display\n\nClick on the + button below to create a note"):Verify that a TextView indicating an empty state is displayed, confirming that all notes have been deleted
~~~

This assertion checks for the presence of a TextView that indicates there are no notes to display, which is equivalent to the "Empty Trash" message in the source test case. The specific text and ID are adjusted to match the target application's UI.

If this assertion passes, it would confirm that we have successfully migrated the core functionality of the test case: deleting all items and verifying the empty state. However, to ensure we've fully completed the test case migration, we should check if there are any remaining notes that need to be deleted.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the assertion:

```
assert d(resourceId="com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/empty").get_text() == "No notes to display\n\nClick on the + button below to create a note"
```

This code checks if the TextView with the specified resource ID contains the expected text, verifying that the empty state message is displayed correctly after all notes have been deleted.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated most of the steps from the source test case to the target application. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've opened the main view of the app.
2. We've selected a note from the list.
3. We've accessed the options menu.
4. We've deleted multiple notes.
5. We've verified that the deleted notes no longer exist.
6. We've confirmed that an empty state message is displayed.

The main difference between the source and target apps is that the target app doesn't seem to have a specific "trash" or "delete all" functionality. Instead, we've had to delete notes individually.

Given that we've completed the main objectives of the test case (deleting all items and verifying the empty state), we can consider this migration complete. However, to ensure we've covered all bases, let's perform one final check:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (640, 72), click, NULL):Click on the options menu to check for any remaining delete or clear all options
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/empty, (0, 640), matches, "No notes to display\n\nClick on the + button below to create a note"):Verify again that the empty state message is still displayed
DONE
~~~

This final check ensures that we haven't missed any "delete all" or "clear" options that might be available in the menu, and confirms once more that the app is in an empty state. With this, we can confidently say that we've successfully migrated the test case from the source application to the target application, adapting to the differences in their implementations.
I understand. I'll convert the given actions into UIAutomator2 code in Python, using the device variable name 'd' as specified. Here's the conversion:

···
d.click(640, 72)
assert d(resourceId="com.moonpi.swiftnotes:id/empty").get_text() == "No notes to display\n\nClick on the + button below to create a note"
···

This code does the following:
1. Clicks on the options menu at the specified coordinates (640, 72).
2. Verifies that the empty state message is still displayed by checking the text of the element with the given resource ID.
