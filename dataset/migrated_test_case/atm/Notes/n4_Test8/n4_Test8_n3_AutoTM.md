#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided function description and the current page's intent description, it appears we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to open the main view. Let's start with that:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (32, 93), click, "Writeily Pro"):Click on the app title "Writeily Pro" to open the main view
~~~

This action corresponds to the first step in the source test case, which is to open the main view. Although the exact element and action are different (LinearLayout click in the source vs TextView click in the target), the purpose is the same - to ensure we're in the main view of the app.
I understand. Based on the given action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

```
d.click(32, 93)
```

This code uses the coordinates (32, 93) to click on the app title "Writeily Pro" to open the main view. As per your instructions, I've used the coordinates since they are provided and precise, which is the preferred method of interaction.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in migrating the test case. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've successfully clicked on the app title "Writeily Pro" to open the main view.
2. The next step in the source test case is to click on the third item in the main list view.

Looking at the current page's intentions, we can see that there's a ListView with the id "me.writeily:id/notes_listview". This is likely the equivalent of the main list view in the source app. However, we don't have a specific action for clicking the third item. Instead, we'll click on the ListView and assume it selects an item (possibly the first one visible).

Here's the next action to take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, me.writeily:id/notes_listview, (0, 272), click, NULL):Click on the notes list to select an item
~~~

This action attempts to match step 2 of the source test case. After executing this action, we should evaluate the result and determine if we need to take additional steps to fully match the source test case's intention of selecting a specific item.
Based on the provided information, I will convert the action into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the converted code:

```
d.click(0, 272)
```

This code uses the coordinates provided (0, 272) to perform a click action on the notes list. Since coordinates are available and preferred, I've used them directly instead of using the resource ID or other attributes.

Based on the provided information, it appears we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first two steps of the source test case have been executed successfully in the target app. Now, let's proceed with the next step of the migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (640, 72), click, NULL):Click to open the options menu to find the delete all option
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in the source test case, where we need to find the "Delete All" option. In the target app, it seems this option might be located in the overflow menu, represented by the ImageView at coordinates (640, 72). By clicking this, we should be able to access additional options, potentially including a "Delete All" or similar function.
Understood. I'll convert the given action into UIAutomator2 code using Python, focusing on using coordinates as the primary method for interaction. Here's the converted code:

···
d.click(640, 72)
···

This code uses the device variable 'd' as specified, and clicks on the coordinates (640, 72) to open the options menu where the delete all option can be found.

ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (320, 72), click, NULL): Click to open the options menu. The menu contains two items: "从设备导入" (Import from device) with id "me.writeily:id/title" and "设置" (Settings) with id "me.writeily:id/title".
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (320, 72), longClick, NULL): Opens a popup menu with "Import from device" option. Selecting this option navigates to a file selection dialog with title "从设备导入" and a scrollable list view (id: me.writeily:id/notes_listview) containing various device folders like Android, ColorOS, Music, etc.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/title, (352, 98), click, "从设备导入"): Click to open the import from device dialog. The next page shows a list of folders to import from, with items like "Android", "ColorOS", "Music", etc., each having a title (me.writeily:id/note_title) and path (me.writeily:id/note_extra).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/title, (352, 98), longClick, "从设备导入"): Long click on "从设备导入" (Import from device) to open a dialog for importing files. The dialog contains a list of directories (me.writeily:id/notes_listview) with various system folders like Android, ColorOS, Music, etc., and buttons for "取消" (Cancel) and "选择" (Select) at the bottom.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/title, (352, 194), click, "设置"): Click on "设置" (Settings) to open the settings page. The new page contains various setting options including "主题" (Theme), "启动时打开上次的文件夹" (Open last folder on startup), and "编辑器设置" (Editor settings).

Based on the provided information, we are currently at step 3 of the source test case, which involves deleting all items. However, the target app's interface and functionality seem to differ from the source app. Let's proceed with the next logical step based on the current page's intentions:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (320, 72), click, NULL):Click to open the options menu to find a delete or trash-related option
~~~

This action attempts to open the options menu, which might contain a delete or trash-related option. If this action is successful, we'll need to examine the new menu items in the next step to find an option that could lead to deleting items or accessing the trash.
Based on the given action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d.click(320, 72)
···

This code will click at the coordinates (320, 72) to open the options menu, as specified in the action description. The coordinates are used directly, as they are provided and precise, which is the preferred method according to the requirements.

Based on the provided information, it appears we are currently at step 3 of the source test case, which involves deleting all items. However, the target app's interface and functionality seem different from the source app. Let's try to find the closest matching action based on the current page's intentions:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/title, (352, 98), click, "从设备导入"):Click to open the import from device dialog to look for a delete or trash-related option
~~~

This action is chosen because:
1. We're looking for a delete or trash-related option, which isn't directly visible in the current menu.
2. Opening the import dialog might reveal more options or lead us to a page where we can manage files, potentially including a delete function.
3. If this doesn't lead to the desired functionality, we'll explore other options in subsequent steps.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we are trying to migrate a test case for deleting all items in the trash and verifying the empty state. However, the current executed actions and the current page's intent description suggest that we are in an "Import from device" dialog, which is not directly related to the trash or delete functionality we're looking for.

Let's try to get back to the main screen and look for trash or delete options:

~~~
RETURN:Return to the main screen to look for trash or delete options
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (368, 1452), click, "取消"):Click the "Cancel" button to close the import dialog and return to the main screen
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (640, 72), click, NULL):Click to open the options menu again to look for trash or delete options
~~~
I understand. I'll convert the given actions into UIAutomator2 code using Python, with the device variable name 'd'. I'll focus on using coordinates where available, and follow the specified format. Here's the conversion:

···
d.press('back')
d.click(368, 1452)
d.click(640, 72)
···

This code performs the following actions:
1. Returns to the main screen using the back button.
2. Clicks the "Cancel" button at coordinates (368, 1452) to close the import dialog.
3. Clicks at coordinates (640, 72) to open the options menu again.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have navigated to the settings page of the Writeily Pro app. However, we haven't found a direct match for the "Delete All" functionality in the trash as described in the source test case. Let's explore the settings to see if we can find any trash-related options or if we need to return to the main screen to look for the trash functionality.

Here's the next step I suggest:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, android:id/list, (0, 176), click, NULL):Scroll through the settings list to look for any trash or delete-related options
~~~

This action will allow us to explore the settings list and potentially find any trash-related settings or options that might lead us to the functionality we're looking for. If we don't find anything relevant in the settings, we'll need to return to the main screen and look for the trash or delete options there.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

```
d.click(0, 176)
d.swipe(0, 800, 0, 200)
```

This code does the following:
1. Clicks on the specified coordinates (0, 176) to ensure the ListView is in focus.
2. Performs a swipe gesture from bottom to top of the screen to scroll through the settings list.

The swipe coordinates are approximated based on a typical Android screen size. Adjust these values if needed for the specific device being used.

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we are in the settings page of the Writeily Pro app. The source test case is about deleting all items in the trash, but we haven't found a direct way to access the trash or delete all items yet. Let's continue exploring the settings to see if we can find any relevant options.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, android:id/list, (0, 176), click, NULL):Scroll through the settings list to look for any trash or delete-related options
~~~

This action will help us explore more of the settings page to find any options related to trash or deleting items.
I understand. Based on the given action, I'll convert it to UIAutomator2 code using the device variable name 'd'. Here's the conversion:

···
d.click(0, 176)
d(resourceId="android:id/list").scroll.toEnd(steps=10)
···

This code does the following:
1. Clicks at the coordinates (0, 176) to ensure the list is in focus.
2. Scrolls the list view to the end, which allows checking for any trash or delete-related options that might be at the bottom of the settings list.

I've used the coordinates for the initial click as specified in the action. Then, I've added a scroll action to go through the entire list, as the purpose is to look for trash or delete-related options which could be anywhere in the list.

Based on the provided information and the executed action sequence, it appears that we are still in the process of finding a way to delete all items or access the trash in the Writeily Pro app. The source test case is about deleting all items in the trash, but we haven't found a direct equivalent in the target app yet. Let's continue exploring the app to find the closest match for this functionality.

Given that we've already checked the settings and couldn't find a trash-related option, let's return to the main screen and try to find a way to access the trash or delete multiple items.

~~~
RETURN:Return to the main screen to look for trash or delete options
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (640, 72), click, NULL):Click to open the options menu again to look for trash or delete options
~~~
I understand. I'll convert the given actions into UIAutomator2 code using Python, with the device variable name 'd'. I'll prioritize using coordinates when available and follow the specified format. Here's the conversion:

···
d.press('back')
d.click(640, 72)
···

This code does the following:
1. Returns to the main screen using the back button.
2. Clicks on the ImageView at coordinates (640, 72) to open the options menu.
