The detailed process with serial numbers is as follows:

1. ACTION (View, com.iliakplv.notes:id/title, (), longClick, NULL) : Long click on the note title to open the context menu.
2. ACTION (TextView, com.android.internal.app.AlertController$RecycleListView, (3), click, NULL) : Click on the 3rd option in the context menu, which is typically the 'Delete' option.
3. ACTION (Button, android:id/button1, (), click, NULL) : Click on the 'Yes' button in the confirmation dialog to confirm the deletion of the note.
