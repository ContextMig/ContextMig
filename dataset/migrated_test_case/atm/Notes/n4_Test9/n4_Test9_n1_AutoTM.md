#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to open the main menu. Let's match this action with the available intentions on the current page.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (0, 64), click, NULL):Click to open navigation drawer. This reveals a new ListView with id "com.iliakplv.notes:id/navigation_drawer" containing options like "All notes", "(grey)", "(green)", and "New label".
~~~

This action corresponds to the first step in the source test case, which is to open the main menu. The navigation drawer in the target app seems to serve the same purpose as the main menu in the source app. Therefore, this action should successfully migrate the first step of the source test case.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

```
d.click(0, 64)
```

This code snippet will click on the coordinates (0, 64) to open the navigation drawer. Since precise coordinates are provided, we use them directly in the `click` method of the UIAutomator2 device object.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. The source test case is currently at step 1, which involves clicking on the "Pocket Note, Open" button to open the main menu. In the target app, we've already opened the navigation drawer, which is equivalent to opening the main menu. So, we can move on to step 2 of the source test case.

Step 2 involves clicking on the fourth item in the main list view, which likely opens the settings page. In the target app, we don't see a direct "Settings" option, but we can try to find a similar functionality. The closest match might be the "New label" option, which could potentially lead to app settings or customization options.

Here's the next action to take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.iliakplv.notes:id/label_name, (24, 472), click, "New label"):Click on "New label" to potentially access settings or customization options
~~~

This action attempts to navigate to a settings-like page by clicking on the "New label" option. After executing this action, we'll need to evaluate the resulting page to determine if it's similar to the settings page we're looking for in the source test case.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code for the given action:

```
d.click(24, 472)
```

This code uses the coordinates (24, 472) to click on the "New label" TextView element. As per the instructions, coordinates are preferred when they are precise, which is the case here.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently in the process of creating a new label in the target application. This doesn't directly correspond to any step in the source test case, which was focused on navigating to settings and rating the app. However, we can interpret this as part of the navigation process, potentially leading to the settings page. Let's proceed with the next logical step in the target application:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.iliakplv.notes:id/label_name, (110, 563), click, NULL):Click to focus on the text input field for entering the label name
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.iliakplv.notes:id/label_name, (110, 563), input, "Settings"):Input "Settings" as the label name to potentially create a label for accessing settings
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (361, 1013), click, NULL):Click the "Save" button to save the new label
~~~

This sequence of actions attempts to create a new label named "Settings", which might serve as a way to access the settings page in the target application. After executing these actions, we should be able to better align with the source test case's intention of navigating to the settings page.
Based on the provided information, I'll convert the actions into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the code:

```
d.click(110, 563)
d.send_keys("Settings")
d.click(361, 1013)
```

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the text input field at coordinates (110, 563) to focus on it.
2. Inputs the text "Settings" into the focused field.
3. Clicks on the "Save" button at coordinates (361, 1013) to save the new label.

The code uses the coordinate-based approach as requested, which is the optimal choice according to the given instructions.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it seems that we are trying to navigate to the settings page, but the target app doesn't have a direct "Settings" option in its main menu. Instead, we've created a new label called "Settings". However, this doesn't align with the source test case's intention of accessing the actual settings page. Let's try a different approach.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (608, 64), click, NULL):Click on the "More options" button to open a popup menu with options including Settings
ASSERT (android.widget.ListView, , (), contains):Assert that the popup menu contains a "Settings" option
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (), click, "Settings"):Click on the "Settings" option in the popup menu to navigate to the settings page
~~~

This response attempts to navigate to the settings page through the "More options" menu, which is a common location for settings in Android apps. We're assuming that the "Settings" option exists in this menu based on the intention description provided earlier. If this approach is successful, it should take us to the settings page, aligning with step 2 of the source test case.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given actions:

Â·Â·Â·
d.click(608, 64)
assert d(text="Settings").exists()
d(text="Settings").click()
Â·Â·Â·

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the "More options" button using the provided coordinates.
2. Asserts that the popup menu contains a "Settings" option by checking if an element with the text "Settings" exists.
3. Clicks on the "Settings" option in the popup menu.

Note that I've used the coordinates for the first action as they were provided and precise. For the assertion and the final click, I've used the text attribute as it's confirmed and unique in this context.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully navigated to the Settings page, which aligns with step 2 of the source test case. Now, we need to proceed with step 3, which involves clicking on the "Rate us!" button. Let's analyze the current page's intentions to find the most suitable action for this step.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (32, 160), click, NULL):Click on the "Links in note" setting to potentially reveal more options
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (48, 172), contains):Assert that the "Links in note" option is present on the Settings page
~~~
I understand. Based on the provided actions and requirements, I'll convert them into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the implementation:

Â·Â·Â·
d.click(32, 160)
assert "Links in note" in d(resourceId="android:id/title").get_text()
Â·Â·Â·

This code does the following:
1. Clicks on the "Links in note" setting using the provided coordinates.
2. Asserts that the text "Links in note" is contained in the TextView with the resource ID "android:id/title".

I've used coordinates for the click action as per the preference mentioned in the requirements. For the assertion, I've used the resource ID since it's provided and unique.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully navigated to the Settings page, which aligns with step 2 of the source test case. The next step in the source test case is to click on the "Rate us!" button. Let's proceed with this step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (), click, NULL):Click on the "Rate us!" button in the settings page
~~~

This action attempts to find and click on a "Rate us!" button or option within the Settings page. If this action is successful, it should open the app rating interface, which is the intended behavior in the source test case.
Based on the provided information, I'll convert the action into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Since coordinates are not provided and we have a unique ID, I'll use the ID to perform the click action.

Â·Â·Â·
d(resourceId="android:id/title", text="Rate us!").click()
Â·Â·Â·

This code will click on the "Rate us!" button in the settings page using the provided resource ID and text. If you have more precise coordinates for this element in the future, using those would be the preferred method.

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully navigated to the Settings page, which aligns with step 2 of the source test case. Now, we need to proceed with step 3, which is clicking on the "Rate us!" button. However, the last executed action indicates that this attempt failed. Let's try to find an alternative way to perform this action based on the current page's intentions.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (32, 160), click, NULL):Click on the next available setting option to potentially reveal the "Rate us!" button
~~~

This action attempts to navigate through the settings options, as the "Rate us!" button might be located further down the list and not immediately visible.
Based on the provided information, I'll convert the action into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the translation:

Â·Â·Â·
d.click(32, 160)

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently at the settings page of the target application. We have successfully navigated to the settings page, which corresponds to step 2 of the source test case. Now, we need to find and interact with the "Rate us!" button, which is step 3 in the source test case. Let's proceed with the next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (48, 172), click, "Rate us!"):Click on the "Rate us!" button in the settings page to open the rating functionality
~~~

This action attempts to find and click on a TextView with the title "Rate us!" in the settings page. This corresponds to step 3 in the source test case where a button with the id "R.id.settings_$_button_rate" was clicked. In the target app, it seems that the "Rate us!" option might be represented as a TextView instead of a Button, but it should serve the same purpose.

If this action is successful, we can consider the test case migration complete. If it fails, we may need to explore other options or scroll the page to find the "Rate us!" option.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

Â·Â·Â·
d.click(48, 172)
Â·Â·Â·

I've used the coordinates (48, 172) as the primary method to interact with the element, as per your instructions to prefer using coordinates when they are precise. This action will click on the "Rate us!" button in the settings page to open the rating functionality.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided information, I'll continue the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've successfully navigated to the Settings page.
2. We've interacted with the "Links in note" setting.
3. We've attempted to click on the "Rate us!" button but it failed initially.
4. We then clicked on another setting option and successfully clicked on the "Rate us!" button.

Now, let's proceed with the next step in our migration:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (48, 172), contains, "Rate us!"):Verify that the "Rate us!" button is present on the Settings page
DONE
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've added an assertion to verify the presence of the "Rate us!" button, which aligns with the last step of the source test case.
2. Since we've successfully performed all the steps from the source test case (opening the main menu, navigating to the settings page, and clicking on the "Rate us!" button), we can conclude that the test case migration is complete.

The DONE statement indicates that we have successfully migrated all steps of the source test case to the target app. The migration process is now complete.
Based on the provided input, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the assertion:

Â·Â·Â·
assert "Rate us!" in d(resourceId="android:id/title", className="android.widget.TextView").get_text()
Â·Â·Â·

This code checks if the text "Rate us!" is contained within the TextView element at the specified location. I've used the resourceId and className attributes for more precise targeting, as they were provided in the input. However, if you prefer to use coordinates exclusively, you can modify the code as follows:

Â·Â·Â·
assert "Rate us!" in d(className="android.widget.TextView", instance=0).get_text()
Â·Â·Â·

This alternative uses the className and assumes it's the first TextView instance on the screen. If you want to strictly adhere to using coordinates, you could use:

Â·Â·Â·
assert "Rate us!" in d.xpath('//*[@bounds="[48,172][1032,228]"]').get_text()
Â·Â·Â·

This last option uses XPath to locate the element based on its coordinates. Choose the version that best fits your requirements.
