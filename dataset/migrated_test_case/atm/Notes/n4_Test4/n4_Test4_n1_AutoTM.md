#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with a long-click action on a note item in a list view. Let's find a similar action in the target application that matches this functionality.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, com.iliakplv.notes:id/notes_list, (12, 228), long_click, NULL): Long click on the notes list to open a context menu with options for Labels, Share, Info, Delete, and Cancel for the selected note "hello".
~~~

This action corresponds to the first step in the source test case, where we long-click on a note item to open a context menu. The purpose and action type match closely with the source test case. After executing this action, we should see a context menu or dialog appear with various options, similar to the source application.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.long_click(12, 228, 1)
···

This code performs a long click operation at the coordinates (12, 228) on the notes list. The long click duration is set to 1 second, as required in the common operations guidelines. This action will open the context menu with options for Labels, Share, Info, Delete, and Cancel for the selected note "hello".
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (123, 525), click, "hello"): Click on the alert title. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets. The alert dialog remains open with options for Labels, Share, Info, Delete, and Cancel.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (123, 525), longClick, "hello"): Long press on the note title to open the options menu. The menu remains open, showing options for Labels, Share, Info, Delete, and Cancel.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (75, 671), click, "Labels"): Click to view or edit labels for the note. No new page appears, but the action might open a dialog or menu for label management within the current context.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (75, 671), longClick, "Labels"): Long click on the "Labels" option in the context menu to potentially open a submenu or perform a specific action related to labels. No new page or dialog appears after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (75, 963), longClick, "Info"): Long-click on "Info" option to view detailed information about the note. This action opens an information dialog showing the creation and modification dates of the note, with a "Close" button (id: android:id/button2) to dismiss the dialog.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (75, 1109), longClick, "Delete"): Long click on "Delete" option in the note options menu to open a confirmation dialog for deleting the note. The new dialog contains a confirmation message and "Yes" and "No" buttons with IDs "android:id/button1" and "android:id/button2" respectively.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (75, 1255), click, "Cancel"): Click to cancel the current operation and return to the main notes list page. The next page contains a notes list with id "com.iliakplv.notes:id/notes_list" and action buttons for creating new notes and voice input.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (75, 1255), long_click, "Cancel"): Long click on the Cancel button to dismiss the dialog and return to the main note list page. The next page contains a ListView with id "com.iliakplv.notes:id/notes_list" showing the existing notes.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears we are currently at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case has been successfully executed in the target app. Let's proceed with the next step:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (123, 525), is_displayed): Verify that the dialog with options is displayed after the long-click.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (75, 1109), click, NULL): Click on the "Delete" option in the dialog list view.
~~~

Explanation:
1. We first assert that the dialog is displayed, which corresponds to step 2 in the source test case.
2. For step 3 of the source test case, we need to click on an item in the dialog. In the source, it was the third item, but in our target app, we don't have information about the exact order. However, we can see that "Delete" is one of the options, which is likely to be the intended action for this test case. Therefore, we choose to click on the "Delete" option.

This approach maintains the functional similarity of the test case while adapting to the specific UI of the target application.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, I'll convert them into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the corresponding code:

···
assert d(resourceId="android:id/alertTitle").exists()
d.click(75, 1109)
···

Explanation:
1. For the ASSERT action, we check if the dialog title is displayed using the resourceId.
2. For the ACTION, we use the coordinates (75, 1109) to click on the "Delete" option, as coordinates are preferred when available.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided information, I'll help you with the next step of the test code migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've completed the first two steps of the source test case:
   - Long-clicking on a note item
   - Verifying that the dialog with options is displayed

2. The third step in the source test case is to click on the third item in the dialog list view.

3. In the executed action sequence, we've already clicked on the "Delete" option, which might not be the third item in the list.

Given this situation, we need to verify if the delete confirmation dialog is displayed and then decide on the next action. Here's the suggested next step:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (123, 525), is_displayed): Verify that the delete confirmation dialog is displayed.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (75, 1255), click, NULL): Click on the "No" button to cancel the delete operation and return to the main notes list.
~~~

Explanation:
1. First, we assert that the delete confirmation dialog is displayed. This is to ensure that the previous "Delete" action was successful and we're on the correct screen.
2. Then, we click on the "No" button (android:id/button2) to cancel the delete operation. This action will dismiss the dialog, which aligns with the fourth step of the source test case (verifying that the dialog is dismissed).

By taking these actions, we're adapting to the differences between the source and target apps while still maintaining the overall flow of the test case. We're verifying the presence of a dialog and then dismissing it, which matches the intent of the original test case.
Based on the provided actions, I'll convert them into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the corresponding code:

···
assert d(resourceId="android:id/alertTitle").exists()
d.click(75, 1255)
···

Explanation:
1. For the ASSERT action, we check if the alert title exists using the resourceId. This verifies that the delete confirmation dialog is displayed.
2. For the ACTION, we use the coordinates (75, 1255) to click on the "No" button, as coordinates are preferred when available.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I can determine that we have successfully migrated the first three steps of the source test case. Let's proceed with the next step:

~~~
ASSERT ((), (), (), is_not_displayed): Verify that the dialog is dismissed after selecting an option.
DONE
~~~

Explanation:
1. We have already performed the long-click action on a note item, which corresponds to step 1 of the source test case.
2. We verified that the dialog with options was displayed, matching step 2 of the source test case.
3. We clicked on an option in the dialog (in this case, "Delete"), which aligns with step 3 of the source test case.
4. Now, we need to verify that the dialog is dismissed, which corresponds to step 4 of the source test case.
5. After verifying that the dialog is dismissed, we have completed all steps of the source test case, so we can conclude with DONE.

The ASSERT action checks that the dialog is no longer displayed, which matches the intention of the original test case. Since we don't have specific element information for this assertion (as it's checking for the absence of something), we use empty parentheses for the element, id, and coordinates fields.
Based on the provided action and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

```
assert not d(className="android.app.Dialog").exists()
```

This code verifies that the dialog is no longer displayed on the screen after an option has been selected. The `assert not` statement checks that the dialog element doesn't exist, which indicates that it has been dismissed.
