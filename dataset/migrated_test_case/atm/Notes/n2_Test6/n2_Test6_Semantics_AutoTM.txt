2. ACTION (MenuItem, R.id.action_delete, (), click, NULL): Click on the delete action in the action bar.

3. ACTION (Button, android.R.id.button1, (), click, NULL): Click on the "OK" button in the confirmation dialog to confirm deletion.

4. ASSERT (TextView, R.id.titleView, (), matches, "Title2"): Verify that the first visible note now has the title "Title2".

5. ACTION (TextView, R.id.titleView, (), long_click, NULL): Long click on the note with title "Title2" to select it.

6. ACTION (MenuItem, R.id.action_delete, (), click, NULL): Click on the delete action in the action bar.

7. ACTION (Button, android.R.id.button1, (), click, NULL): Click on the "OK" button in the confirmation dialog to confirm deletion.
