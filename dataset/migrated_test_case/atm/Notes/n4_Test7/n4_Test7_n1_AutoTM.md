````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with a long-click action on a note in the list view. Let's find a corresponding action in the target application.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, com.iliakplv.notes:id/notes_list, (12, 228), longClick, NULL):Long press on a note item to open a context menu with options including Labels, Share, Info, and Delete.
~~~

This action corresponds to the first step in the source test case, where we long-click on a note to open the context menu. The next step would be to select the "Set Password" option from the context menu, but we'll need to see the new page's intentions to determine if such an option exists.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code for the given action:

···
d.long_click(12, 228, 1)
···

This code performs a long click operation at the specified coordinates (12, 228) for 1 second, which should open the context menu for the note item as described in the action. The use of coordinates is preferred as per the requirements, and the long click duration is set to 1 second as specified in the common operations.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (123, 525), click, "CS200"): Click on the title of the dialog. This action does not navigate to a new page or cause any visible changes as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (123, 525), long_click, "CS200"): Long press on the note title to open options menu. The menu contains options for Labels, Share, Info, and Delete, along with a Cancel button.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (75, 671), click, "Labels"): Click on "Labels" option to manage labels for the note "CS200". No new page appears, but a label management interface may be displayed within the current dialog.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (75, 671), longClick, "Labels"): Open the label selection dialog for the note "CS200". The dialog contains checkboxes for selecting labels like "(orange)" and "bb", along with "Cancel" and "OK" buttons to confirm or discard the selection.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (75, 963), longClick, "Info"): Long click on the "Info" option to view detailed information about the note. The next page shows a dialog with the note's title, creation date, and modification date, along with a "Close" button.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (75, 1109), longClick, "Delete"): Long press on the "Delete" option to open a confirmation dialog for deleting the note. The next page shows a dialog with a title "CS200", a message "Delete this note?", and two buttons "No" (id: android:id/button2) and "Yes" (id: android:id/button1).
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (75, 1255), click, "Cancel"): Click to cancel the current operation and return to the main notes list page. The page after clicking this button is the main notes list, which contains a ListView with id "com.iliakplv.notes:id/notes_list" displaying multiple note items.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears we are currently at the step where we have long-clicked on a note item in the target application, which corresponds to step 1 in the source test case. The next step in the source test case is to select the "Set Password" option from the context menu. However, in the target application, there is no direct "Set Password" option visible in the context menu. Let's proceed with the closest matching action that aligns with the overall goal of the test case.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (75, 963), click, "Info"):Click on the "Info" option to view detailed information about the note, which might include password-related settings.
~~~

This action is chosen because:
1. It's the closest match to accessing additional options for the note, which might include password settings.
2. Viewing the note info could potentially lead to more options, including security settings.
3. If this doesn't lead to password settings, we'll need to explore other options or potentially conclude that the password feature isn't available in the same way in the target app.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(75, 963)
···

I've used the coordinates (75, 963) as the primary method to perform the click action, as per the recommendation to prefer coordinates when they are precise. This code will click on the "Info" option to view detailed information about the note.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (123, 525), click, "CS200"): Click on the title of the dialog. This action does not navigate to a new page or cause any visible changes as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (123, 525), long_click, "CS200"): Long press on the note title to open options menu. The menu contains options for Labels, Share, Info, and Delete, along with a Cancel button.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (75, 671), click, "Labels"): Click on "Labels" option to manage labels for the note "CS200". No new page appears, but a label management interface may be displayed within the current dialog.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (75, 671), longClick, "Labels"): Open the label selection dialog for the note "CS200". The dialog contains checkboxes for selecting labels like "(orange)" and "bb", along with "Cancel" and "OK" buttons to confirm or discard the selection.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (75, 963), longClick, "Info"): Long click on the "Info" option to view detailed information about the note. The next page shows a dialog with the note's title, creation date, and modification date, along with a "Close" button.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (75, 1109), longClick, "Delete"): Long press on the "Delete" option to open a confirmation dialog for deleting the note. The next page shows a dialog with a title "CS200", a message "Delete this note?", and two buttons "No" (id: android:id/button2) and "Yes" (id: android:id/button1).
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (75, 1255), click, "Cancel"): Click to cancel the current operation and return to the main notes list page. The page after clicking this button is the main notes list, which contains a ListView with id "com.iliakplv.notes:id/notes_list" displaying multiple note items.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears we are in the process of migrating a test case for setting a password on a note. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next step:

1. In the source test case, we've completed step 1 (long-clicking on a note) and are now at step 2 (selecting an option from the context menu).

2. In the target app, we've successfully long-clicked on a note item and opened a context menu. However, instead of directly selecting a "Set Password" option (which doesn't appear to be available), we've clicked on the "Info" option.

3. The "Info" option might lead us to a screen where we can manage note settings, potentially including password protection.

Given this context, here's the next action we should take:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (123, 525), text_contains, "CS200"):Verify that we are on the correct note's info page
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (75, 1255), click, NULL):Click on the "Close" button to return to the main notes list, as we didn't find a direct way to set a password from the Info screen
~~~

This action will close the Info dialog and bring us back to the main notes list. From there, we can explore other options to find a way to set a password for the note. If the target app doesn't have a direct "Set Password" option, we might need to look for alternative ways to achieve the same functionality, such as through a general "Settings" or "Security" option.
I understand. I'll convert the given actions into UIAutomator2 code using Python, with the device variable name 'd'. Here's the converted code:

···
assert "CS200" in d(resourceId="android:id/alertTitle").get_text()
d.click(75, 1255)
···

This code does the following:
1. Asserts that the text "CS200" is contained in the alert title, verifying we're on the correct note's info page.
2. Clicks on the "Close" button at the specified coordinates (75, 1255) to return to the main notes list.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information and the executed action sequence, it appears that we are trying to set a password for a note, but the current application doesn't have a direct "Set Password" option in the context menu. Let's try a different approach to achieve our goal.

Since we've returned to the main notes list, let's try to open the note for editing and see if there's an option to set a password there.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, com.iliakplv.notes:id/notes_list, (12, 228), click, NULL):Click on the note to open it for editing
~~~
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d.click(12, 228)
```

This code uses the coordinates (12, 228) to click on the note in the ListView, opening it for editing. As per the requirements, the coordinates are preferred when they are precise, which is the case here.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information and the executed action sequence, it appears that we are trying to set a password for a note in the target application. However, the exact method to set a password is not immediately apparent from the current page's intentions. Let's proceed with the next logical step in the migration process.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (912, 72), click, NULL):Click on "More options" to open a popup menu with additional options, as setting a password might be available in this menu
~~~

This action is chosen because:
1. We've already tried accessing note information through the context menu, but didn't find a direct way to set a password.
2. The "More options" menu might contain additional settings or security features, including the option to set a password.
3. This action aligns with the general flow of the source test case, where we're looking for a way to set a password for a note.

If this action reveals a "Set Password" or similar option, we can proceed with the password setting process. If not, we may need to explore other paths or consider that the password setting feature might be implemented differently in the target application.
I understand. Based on the given action, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

```

Based on the provided information, it appears that we are attempting to set a password for a note in the target application. However, the current sequence of actions has not yet led us to a password setting feature. Let's continue our search for this functionality.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (33, 72), click, NULL):Click on the back button to return to the main notes list
ASSERT (android.widget.ListView, com.iliakplv.notes:id/notes_list, (12, 228), visible):Verify that we are back on the main notes list
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, com.iliakplv.notes:id/notes_list, (12, 228), longClick, NULL):Long press on the note again to open the context menu
~~~

Explanation: Since we haven't found a direct way to set a password in the previous attempts, we're going back to the main list and trying the long-press context menu again. This time, we'll look for any option that might be related to password setting or security.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the provided actions:

```
d.click(33, 72)
assert d(resourceId="com.iliakplv.notes:id/notes_list").exists()
d.long_click(12, 228, 1)
```

This code does the following:

1. Clicks on the back button at coordinates (33, 72).
2. Asserts that the main notes list is visible by checking if the element with the resource ID "com.iliakplv.notes:id/notes_list" exists.
3. Performs a long click at coordinates (12, 228) for 1 second to open the context menu.

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we are currently at the step where we have opened the context menu for a note. We've already attempted to find a password setting option through various paths, but haven't found it yet. Let's continue with the migration process by exploring the available options in the context menu.

Given that the source test case is about setting a password for a note, and we haven't found a direct "Set Password" option, we'll need to explore other possibilities. The "Info" option might contain password-related settings, so let's try that again.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (75, 963), click, "Info"):Click on the "Info" option to view detailed information about the note, which might include password-related settings.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have not yet found a direct way to set a password for a note in the target application. The source test case involves setting a password, but the target app doesn't seem to have an obvious password-setting feature in the places we've checked so far. Let's try a different approach.

Given that we've already explored the "Info" option and didn't find a password setting there, let's try the "Labels" option, as it might be used differently in this app to categorize or protect notes.

Here's the next step I suggest:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (75, 1255), click, NULL):Click on the "Close" button to return to the main notes list
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, com.iliakplv.notes:id/notes_list, (12, 228), longClick, NULL):Long press on the note again to open the context menu
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (75, 671), click, "Labels"):Click on "Labels" option to check if it's used for note protection or categorization
~~~

This sequence of actions will close the current info dialog, return to the main list, open the context menu again, and then explore the "Labels" option. We're doing this to see if the "Labels" feature in the target app might be used in a way that's analogous to password protection in the source app.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given actions:

```
d.click(75, 1255)
d.long_click(12, 228, 1)
d(text="Labels").click()
```

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the "Close" button at coordinates (75, 1255).
2. Long-clicks on the note at coordinates (12, 228) for 1 second to open the context menu.
3. Clicks on the "Labels" option using the text attribute.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (123, 671), click, "CS200"): Click on the alert title "CS200". This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the current and next page JSONs are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (123, 671), longClick, "CS200"): Long press on the alert title to possibly trigger additional options or actions related to the "CS200" item. No new page or dialog appears after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.CheckBox, com.iliakplv.notes:id/checkbox, (111, 817), click, NULL): Click to toggle the selection of the "(orange)" label. The checkbox state changes, but no new page or dialog appears.
ACTION (android.widget.CheckBox, com.iliakplv.notes:id/checkbox, (111, 817), longClick, NULL): Long click on the checkbox to select or deselect the label. No new page appears, but the checkbox state might toggle.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.iliakplv.notes:id/label_name, (387, 846), click, "(orange)"): Click on the label name to select it. No new page appears, but the checkbox associated with this label might be toggled.

ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (75, 1109), click, "Cancel"): Click to dismiss the label selection dialog without applying changes. The page returns to the main note list view with elements such as a navigation drawer, action buttons for new note and voice input, and a ListView containing multiple note items.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (75, 1109), longClick, "Cancel"): Long click on the "Cancel" button to dismiss the label selection dialog. The action returns to the main note list page, which contains a ListView with id "com.iliakplv.notes:id/notes_list" displaying multiple note items.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (541, 1109), click, "OK"): Click to confirm label selection for the note. The page after clicking this button returns to the main note list page, which contains a ListView with id "com.iliakplv.notes:id/notes_list" displaying multiple notes.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (541, 1109), longClick, "OK"): Long click on the "OK" button to confirm the label selection. This action returns to the main notes list page, which contains a ListView with id "com.iliakplv.notes:id/notes_list" displaying multiple note items.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we are currently on a label selection dialog for a note. The source test case is about setting a password for a note, but we haven't found a direct way to set a password in this application. Let's continue our exploration to find a similar functionality or the closest alternative.

Given that we've explored various options and haven't found a direct "Set Password" feature, we might need to consider an alternative approach. Labels could potentially be used as a form of categorization or protection for notes. Let's proceed with selecting a label and then verify if it adds any form of protection or categorization to the note.

Here's the next step in our migration process:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.CheckBox, com.iliakplv.notes:id/checkbox, (111, 817), click, NULL):Select the "(orange)" label as a potential alternative to password protection
ASSERT (android.widget.CheckBox, com.iliakplv.notes:id/checkbox, (111, 817), checked):Verify that the "(orange)" label is selected
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (541, 1109), click, "OK"):Confirm the label selection and return to the main note list
ASSERT (android.widget.ListView, com.iliakplv.notes:id/notes_list, (12, 228), visible):Verify that we are back on the main notes list
~~~

This step attempts to use the label feature as an alternative to password protection. We're selecting a label, confirming it, and then returning to the main list. After this, we should check if the label has been applied to the note and if it provides any form of protection or categorization.
Based on the provided actions and assertions, I'll convert them into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the code:

```
# Select the "(orange)" label
d.click(111, 817)

# Verify that the "(orange)" label is selected
assert d(resourceId="com.iliakplv.notes:id/checkbox", className="android.widget.CheckBox").info['checked']

# Confirm the label selection and return to the main note list
d.click(541, 1109)

# Verify that we are back on the main notes list
assert d(resourceId="com.iliakplv.notes:id/notes_list", className="android.widget.ListView").exists
```

This code follows the given actions and assertions, using coordinates where available and resource IDs where necessary. It also includes the required assertions to verify the state after each action.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that the target application does not have a direct option to set a password for a note. The test case migration needs to be adapted to the available features in the target app. Let's proceed with an alternative approach that achieves a similar goal of protecting or categorizing the note.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (912, 72), click, NULL):Click on the "More options" button to open the menu with additional options
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (516, 1003), click, "Settings"):Click on "Settings" to check for any security-related options
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/action_bar_title, (145, 107), text_equals, "Settings"):Verify that we are on the Settings page
~~~

This response suggests checking the Settings page for any security-related options that might be similar to setting a password for a note. If we don't find a password option in the Settings, we'll need to consider alternative ways to achieve a similar level of protection or categorization for the note.
I understand your requirements. I'll convert the given actions into UIAutomator2 code using Python, focusing on coordinates when available and using other attributes when necessary. Here's the converted code:

```
d.click(912, 72)
d.click(516, 1003)
assert d(resourceId="android:id/action_bar_title").get_text() == "Settings"
```

This code does the following:
1. Clicks on the "More options" button using the provided coordinates.
2. Clicks on the "Settings" option using the provided coordinates.
3. Verifies that the action bar title text is "Settings", using the resourceId to locate the element.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have explored various options to set a password for a note, but haven't found a direct way to do so in this application. The functionality seems to be different from the source test case. Let's try to find an alternative way to protect the note or conclude that this feature is not available.

Given that we're now on the Settings page, let's check if there are any security-related options:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, android:id/list, (0, 228), click, NULL):Scroll through the settings list to look for any security or password-related options
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (), text_contains, "security"):Check if there's any security-related setting
NOT FOUND
~~~
Based on the provided actions and requirements, I'll convert them into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the resulting code:

```
d.click(0, 228)
assert "security" in d(resourceId="android:id/title").get_text().lower()
```

This code does the following:

1. Clicks on the ListView at the specified coordinates (0, 228) to scroll through the settings list.
2. Checks if there's any security-related setting by asserting that the text "security" is contained in the title of any item (case-insensitive).

Note that the assertion might raise an exception if no security-related setting is found, which aligns with the "NOT FOUND" status in the input. If you want to handle this gracefully, you might consider wrapping the assertion in a try-except block.
