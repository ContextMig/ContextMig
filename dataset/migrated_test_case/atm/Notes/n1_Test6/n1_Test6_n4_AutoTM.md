#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with creating a new note, so we should look for a similar action in the target application. From the current page's intent description, we can see that there are multiple ways to add a new note. Let's choose the most straightforward option.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/notes_menu_$_add, (608, 64), click, NULL):Click to add a new note
~~~

This action corresponds to step 1 in the source test case, where we click on the "New note" action menu item to create a new note. The next step should be to enter the title of the new note.
Based on the provided action and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to click and add a new note:

```
d.click(608, 64)
```

This code uses the coordinates (608, 64) to perform the click action, which is the preferred method as per the requirements. The click will add a new note as described in the action.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (16, 64), click, NULL): Click on the app title bar to return to the main screen. The page remains the same after clicking, with no new elements appearing.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, widget id empty, (16, 64), long click, NULL): Long clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page but maintains the current page where the user continues editing the note with options like altering note color with id "chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/editor_$_button_pick_color" or adding text via EditText with id "chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/editor_$_note_editor".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/action_bar_title, (96, 87), click, "Pocket Note"): Click on the title "Pocket Note" to return to the main page. However, clicking this element does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the current and next page JSONs are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/action_bar_title, (96, 87), long click, "Pocket Note"): Long click on this control does not navigate to a new page or introduce new items. It remains in the current note editing page, where an editor and color pick button are present.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/editor_$_edittext_title, (10, 170), click, NULL): Click to initiate note title editor. After clicking, the app remains on the same page, but the note title editor becomes focused, allowing the user to input the note title directly.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/editor_$_edittext_title, (10, 170), long_click, NULL): Open the note editor for editing by long clicking on the widget. There are no changes to the page or widgets after this action, implying it might activate contextual options such as clipboard controls.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/editor_$_button_pick_color, (641, 170), click, NULL): Click to select note color. Clicking on this button opens a color selection menu with options such as "Red", "Yellow", "Orange", "Grey", "Green", "Brown", "Cyan", "Purple", and "Blue".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/editor_$_button_pick_color, (641, 170), longClick, NULL): Long press to open the color selection menu. This enables the user to select different colors for the given note. After this action, the color selection menu with different color options like Red, Yellow, Orange, Grey, Green, Brown, Cyan, Purple, and Blue appears.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/editor_$_note_editor, (0, 249), click, NULL): Purpose is to enable the user to input text for the note. Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page but enables text input for note taking.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/editor_$_note_editor, (0, 249), long_click, NULL): Long-pressing on the note editor does not navigate to a new page nor present any new interactive widgets. It might bring up context-specific actions such as text selection or paste options.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case has been executed successfully, which is creating a new note. Now, we need to proceed with entering the title of the new note. Here's the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/editor_$_edittext_title, (10, 170), input, "Title2"):Enter "Title2" as the title of the new note
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 in the source test case. We're using the EditText widget with the id "chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/editor_$_edittext_title" to input the title "Title2". This matches the functionality of entering a title for the new note in the source test case.
Based on the given action, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified task:

···
d.click(10, 170)
d.send_keys("Title2")
···

This code will:
1. Click on the coordinates (10, 170) where the EditText for the title is located.
2. Input the text "Title2" into the title field.

I've used the coordinates as specified in the action description, which is the preferred method according to the requirements. This approach should reliably interact with the intended UI element to enter the title for the new note.

A dropdown list appears with color options (Red, Yellow, Orange, Grey, Green, Brown, Cyan, Purple, Blue) for the note, each with id "chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/color_dropdown_item_$_checkedtextview_name".
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/editor_$_note_editor, (0, 249), click, NULL): Click to focus on the note editor and allow text input. No new page or widgets appear after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/editor_$_note_editor, (0, 249), longClick, NULL): Long click on the note editor to potentially bring up a context menu or additional options for text editing. No new page or dialog appears after this action.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at step 3 of the source test case. We have successfully created a new note and entered the title "Title2". The next step is to enter the body text "Text2" into the note editor. Let's proceed with this action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/editor_$_note_editor, (0, 249), input, "Text2"):Enter "Text2" as the body of the new note
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in the source test case, where we input the body text of the note. We're using the note editor field identified in the current page's intent description to perform this action.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d.click(0, 249)
d.send_keys("Text2")
···

This code does the following:
1. Clicks on the specified coordinates (0, 249) which corresponds to the EditText field.
2. Uses the send_keys method to input the text "Text2" into the field.

This approach follows the requirement to prefer using coordinates when they are precise, which is the case here. It also adheres to the specified method for setting text in an input box when the widget's coordinates are known.

Based on the provided information, we can see that the first three steps of the source test case have been successfully executed in the target application. Now, let's proceed with the next step of the migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/notes_menu_$_save, (608, 64), click, NULL):Click on the save button to save the note
~~~

This action corresponds to step 4 in the source test case: "Click on the "Done" action menu item to save the note." In the target application, we're using the save button with the id "chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/notes_menu_$_save" to accomplish the same task.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(608, 64)
···

This code uses the coordinates (608, 64) to click on the save button, which is the preferred method as per the given instructions. The device variable name is set to 'd' as specified in the input.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I will proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Here's my analysis and recommendation:

1. We have successfully completed steps 1-4 of the source test case, which involve creating a new note, entering a title and body, and saving the note.

2. The next steps in the source test case (steps 5 and 6) are assertions to verify that the note title "Title2" and body "Text2" are displayed.

3. However, the current page's intent description doesn't show a list view of notes. Instead, we're still on the note editing page.

4. To align with the source test case, we should first navigate back to the main note list view before performing the assertions.

Given this analysis, here's the next action I recommend:

~~~
RETURN:Navigate back to the main note list view to verify the saved note
~~~

This action will take us back to the main list of notes, where we can then verify that the newly created note is displayed correctly. After this action is executed, we should be able to perform the assertions similar to steps 5 and 6 of the source test case.
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.press('back')
···

This code uses the device variable 'd' as specified in the device variable name. The RETURN action is translated to a simple 'back' press, which will navigate back to the main note list view as requested.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully completed the first four steps of the source test case. We've created a new note, entered the title "Title2" and content "Text2", and saved it. The next logical step would be to verify that the note has been saved correctly. However, since we've returned to the main note list view, we need to check if the newly created note is visible there. Here's the next action I recommend:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/notes_row_$_textview_title, (), matches, "Title2"):Verify that the note title "Title2" is displayed in the note list
~~~

This assertion checks if the title "Title2" is visible in the note list, which corresponds to step 5 in the source test case. If this assertion passes, we can proceed to the next step of creating another note.
Based on the provided information, I'll convert the action into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the corresponding code:

```
assert d(resourceId="chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/notes_row_$_textview_title", text="Title2").exists()
```

This code checks if a TextView with the specified resource ID and text "Title2" exists in the note list. The `exists()` method is used to verify the presence of the element, which aligns with the "matches" assertion in the input.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully completed steps 1-6 of the source test case. We have created a new note with the title "Title2" and content "Text2", saved it, and verified its presence in the note list. Now, we should proceed with creating another note as described in steps 7-10 of the source test case. Here's the next action to take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/notes_menu_$_add, (608, 64), click, NULL):Click to add a new note
~~~

This action corresponds to step 7 in the source test case, where we click on the "New note" action menu item to create another new note. The coordinates and id are based on the previously successful action for adding a new note.
Based on the provided information, I'll convert the action into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the conversion:

···
d.click(608, 64)
···

This code uses the coordinate-based click method, which is the preferred option as per the instructions. The action is to click on the add button to create a new note, and the coordinates (608, 64) are used to perform this action.

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, we are now at the step of creating the second note in the test case. Let's proceed with the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/editor_$_edittext_title, (10, 170), input, "Title1"):Enter "Title1" as the title of the new note
~~~

This action corresponds to step 8 in the source test case, where we enter "Title1" as the title of the new note. We're using the same EditText field as before, but with a different input value.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the action:

```
d.click(10, 170)
d.send_keys("Title1")
```

This code will click on the EditText field at the specified coordinates (10, 170) and then input the text "Title1" as the title of the new note.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently at step 9 of the source test case, which involves entering the body text for the second note. Here's the next action to take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/editor_$_note_editor, (0, 249), input, "Text1"):Enter "Text1" as the body of the new note
~~~

This action corresponds to step 9 in the source test case, where we input "Text1" as the body of the new note. The target app seems to have a similar structure to the source app, with separate fields for the title and body of the note. We're using the editor field identified by "chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/editor_$_note_editor" to input the note body.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(0, 249)
d.send_keys("Text1")
···

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (0, 249) where the EditText is located, and then sends the input "Text1" to the field. This approach uses the coordinates as preferred in the requirements, rather than using the resource ID.

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully created two notes with titles "Title2" and "Title1" respectively. The next step in the source test case is to verify that the second note (Title1) is displayed. Then, we need to sort the notes by title. Let's proceed with these steps:

~~~
RETURN:Navigate back to the main note list view to verify the saved notes

ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/notes_row_$_textview_title, (), matches, "Title1"):Verify that the note title "Title1" is displayed in the note list

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/action_bar_title, (96, 87), longClick, "Pocket Note"):Long click on the app title to potentially access additional options or sorting menu
~~~

I'm suggesting these actions because:

1. We need to return to the main note list to verify the newly created notes.
2. We need to assert that "Title1" is visible in the list, as per the source test case.
3. Since there's no direct "Sort" option visible in the current page's intentions, we're attempting to access additional options by long-clicking the app title. This might reveal a sorting option or menu.

Please execute these actions and provide me with the updated current page's intentions and the result of the executed actions. This will help determine the next steps for sorting the notes by title.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, I'll convert them into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the corresponding code:

···
d.press('back')

assert d(resourceId="chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/notes_row_$_textview_title", text="Title1").exists()

Based on the provided information, we are currently at step 14 of the source test case, where we need to open the options menu and select the "Sort" option. However, the executed action sequence shows that we've already performed a long click on the app title, which might have opened additional options. Let's proceed with the next step to sort the notes by title.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (), click, NULL):Click on the "Sort" option in the menu
~~~

This action attempts to click on the "Sort" option that should be available after the long click on the app title. If this action is successful, we'll proceed to select the "By title" sorting option in the next step.
Based on the provided action and requirements, I'll convert the action into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Since coordinates are preferred and no specific coordinates are provided, I'll use the text attribute to locate the element.

```
d(text="Sort").click()
```

This code uses the UIAutomator2 device variable 'd' to find the TextView element with the text "Sort" and clicks on it. This action should open the sorting options or apply a sort to the list, depending on the app's functionality.

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it seems we've successfully created two notes with titles "Title2" and "Title1", and we're now at the step where we need to sort the notes. However, the last action to access the sorting menu failed. Let's try an alternative approach to access the sorting functionality.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/notes_menu_$_more, (656, 64), click, NULL):Click on the more options menu to access additional features including sorting

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it seems that we've successfully created two notes with titles "Title2" and "Title1" respectively, and we're now at the step where we need to sort the notes. However, the long-click on the app title didn't reveal the sorting option as expected. Let's proceed with the next step using the more options menu that we've just opened.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (), click, "Sort"):Click on the "Sort" option in the more options menu to access sorting choices
~~~

This action attempts to find and click on the "Sort" option within the more options menu that we've just opened. This corresponds to step 14 in the source test case, where we're trying to access the sorting functionality.
Based on the provided information, I'll convert the action into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Since coordinates are not provided and there's no unique ID, we'll use the text attribute for this action. Here's the code:

···
d(text="Sort").click()
···

This code will click on the TextView element with the text "Sort", which should open the sorting options menu as described in the action.

#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (16, 64), click, NULL): Click on the app title bar to return to the main screen or refresh the current note. No new page or widgets appear after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (16, 64), longClick, NULL): Long click on the top bar to potentially reveal additional options or menu items. No new page or widgets appear after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/action_bar_title, (96, 87), click, "Pocket Note"): Click on the app title to potentially access app settings or return to the main screen. No new page or widgets appear after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/action_bar_title, (96, 87), longClick, "Pocket Note"): Long click on the app title "Pocket Note" in the action bar. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger the appearance of new widgets.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/editor_$_edittext_title, (10, 170), click, "Title1"): Click to edit the title of the note. No new page or widgets appear, but the keyboard likely pops up for text input.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/editor_$_edittext_title, (10, 170), long_click, "Title1"): Long click on the title field to open a context menu with options including translate, cut, copy, paste, and share. The menu appears at the top of the screen with buttons for these actions.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/editor_$_button_pick_color, (641, 170), click, NULL): Opens a color picker dropdown menu with options including Red, Yellow, Orange, Grey, Green, Brown, Cyan, Purple, and Blue. Each color option has a clickable TextView with id "chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/color_dropdown_item_$_checkedtextview_name".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/editor_$_button_pick_color, (641, 170), long_click, NULL): Long click to open color selection menu. A dropdown menu appears with color options like Red, Yellow, Orange, Grey, Green, Brown, Cyan, Purple, and Blue, each with id "chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/color_dropdown_item_$_checkedtextview_name".
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/editor_$_note_editor, (0, 249), click, "Text1"): Click to edit the note content. The page remains the same, allowing the user to input or modify the text in the note editor.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/editor_$_note_editor, (0, 249), longClick, "Text1"): Long click on the note editor to open a context menu with options for text manipulation, including translate, cut, copy, paste, and share.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it seems that we have successfully created two notes with titles "Title2" and "Title1" respectively. We are now at the step where we need to sort the notes by title. However, the attempt to access the sorting option through long-clicking the app title and clicking on a "Sort" option has failed. Let's try to find an alternative way to sort the notes based on the current page's intentions.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/notes_menu_$_more, (656, 64), click, NULL):Click on the more options menu to access additional features including sorting
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (), click, "Sort by title"):Click on the "Sort by title" option in the more options menu to sort notes alphabetically by title
~~~

I'm suggesting these actions because:

1. We've already tried to access the sorting option through the app title, which didn't work.
2. The current page's intentions show a "more options" menu (chan.android.app.pocketnote:id/notes_menu_$_more) which might contain the sorting feature.
3. We're looking for a way to sort the notes by title, so we're assuming there might be a "Sort by title" option in this menu.

If this action succeeds, we should then verify that the notes are sorted correctly. If it fails, we'll need to explore other options or potentially skip the sorting step if it's not available in this app.
Based on the provided information and requirements, I'll convert the given actions into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the conversion:

···
d.click(656, 64)
d(text="Sort by title").click()
···

This code does the following:

1. Clicks on the more options menu at the coordinates (656, 64).
2. Clicks on the "Sort by title" option using the text attribute, as specified in the requirements.

The code uses the device variable name 'd' as provided, and prioritizes using coordinates for the first action. For the second action, it uses the text attribute as the coordinates were not provided and the text is confirmed.

### Fail - n4 dose not have sort function, but other steps are migrated successfully.
