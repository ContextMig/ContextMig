#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with creating a new note, so we should look for a similar action in the target application. Let's proceed with the first step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, me.writeily:id/fab_expand_menu_button, (540, 1428), click, NULL): Click to expand the floating action menu to access the option for creating a new note
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, me.writeily:id/create_note, (540, 1116), click, NULL): Click on the "create_note" button to start creating a new note
~~~

This sequence of actions corresponds to the first step in the source test case: "Click on the 'New note' action menu item to create a new note." In the target application, we need to first expand the floating action menu and then click on the create note button.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given actions:

···
d.click(540, 1428)
d.click(540, 1116)
···

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the floating action menu button to expand it.
2. Clicks on the "create_note" button to start creating a new note.

The code uses the coordinates provided in the action descriptions, as they are precise and available. This approach is preferred according to the requirements.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL): Click to return to the previous page, which displays a list of notes with a search button (id: me.writeily:id/search_button) and a floating action button (id: me.writeily:id/fab_expand_menu_button).
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, "", (0, 64), longClick, NULL): Long press on the "转到上一层级" (Back) button to return to the main page with the note list, which includes a ListView with id "me.writeily:id/notes_listview" containing note entries.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), click, "标题"): Click to focus on the note title field for editing. No new page or elements appear as this action only activates the text input for the title.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), long_click, "标题"): Long click on the note title field to select text or bring up text editing options. No new page or dialog appears, as the current and next page JSONs are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (528, 72), click, NULL): Click to open the share options for the current note. The next page is not available, but typically this would open a system share dialog with various sharing options.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (528, 72), longclick, NULL): Long press on the share button to open sharing options. No new page appears, but a sharing menu or dialog is likely to be displayed with various sharing options.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_preview, (624, 72), click, NULL): Click to switch from edit mode to preview mode. The page changes to display a WebView for previewing the content, and the action_preview button is replaced with an action_edit button to allow switching back to edit mode.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_preview, (624, 72), long_click, NULL): Long click on the preview button to possibly reveal additional options or perform a specific action related to previewing the note content. No new page or dialog appears after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 180), click, NULL): Click to focus and enable text input in the note content area. No new page or widgets appear as this action activates the existing text input field.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 180), longClick, NULL): Long click on the note content area to open a context menu for text editing options. The context menu may include options like copy, paste, cut, or select all.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the step of creating a new note in the target application. This corresponds to step 1 in the source test case. Let's proceed with the next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), input, "Title2"): Enter "Title2" as the title of the new note
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 in the source test case, where we input the title of the new note. We're using the edit_note_title field identified in the current page's intentions to input the title "Title2".
Based on the provided information, I will convert the action into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the code:

···
d.click(144, 64)
d.send_keys("Title2")
···

This code does the following:
1. Clicks on the coordinates (144, 64) where the EditText for the note title is located.
2. Sends the keys "Title2" to input the title of the new note.

I've used the coordinates as the primary method for interaction, as per your preference. The device variable name 'd' is used as specified in the input.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL): Click the back button to return to the previous page, which shows a list of notes including the recently edited "Title2" note with last modified date "2024/8/26 17:19".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), longClick, NULL): Long click on the back button to return to the previous level. The next page shows a list of notes, with a new note titled "Title2" added to the list, visible in the ListView with id "me.writeily:id/notes_listview".
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), click, "Title2"): Click on the note title to edit it. Clicking on this control allows the user to modify the title of the note, but does not navigate to a new page or bring up any new dialogs or components.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), long_click, "Title2"): Long click on the note title to bring up a text selection menu with options for translation, cut, copy, paste, and share. The menu appears at coordinates (32, 196) with various clickable options.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (528, 72), click, NULL): Click to share the current note. Clicking this control opens a system share dialog with options to share the note content through various apps.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (528, 72), longClick, NULL): Long click on the share button to open sharing options. No new page appears, but a sharing menu or dialog is likely to be displayed with various sharing options.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_preview, (624, 72), click, NULL): Click to preview the note content. The page changes to a preview mode with a WebView to display the formatted note content, and the action button changes to an edit button with id "me.writeily:id/action_edit".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_preview, (624, 72), longClick, NULL): Long click on the preview button to potentially access additional preview options or settings. No new page or dialog appears, as the JSON structure remains unchanged after the interaction.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 180), click, NULL): Click to focus on the note content area for editing. No new page or widgets appear, as this action simply activates the text input field for the user to start typing or editing the note content.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 180), longClick, NULL): Long click on the note content area to activate text selection or editing options. No new page or dialog appears, but the text selection or editing functionality may be activated within the same page.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at step 3 of the source test case. We have successfully created a new note and entered the title "Title2". The next step is to enter the content of the note. Here's the next action to take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 180), input, "Text2"): Enter "Text2" as the body of the new note
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in the source test case, where we input the content of the note. We're using the EditText widget with id "me.writeily:id/note_content" to input the text "Text2" into the note body. This matches the functionality of the source test case while adapting to the specific UI elements of the target application.
Based on the given information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the specified action:

···
d.click(0, 180)
d.send_keys("Text2")
···

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (0, 180) where the EditText widget is located, and then sends the text "Text2" to the input field. This approach follows the requirement to prefer using coordinates when they are precise, and it also adheres to the specified method for setting text to an input box.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL): Click on the back button to return to the previous page. The new page displays a list of notes with a "Writeily Pro" header, a search button (id: me.writeily:id/search_button), and a floating action button (id: me.writeily:id/fab_expand_menu_button).
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), longClick, NULL): Long click on the "转到上一层级" (Go back) button to return to the previous screen, which displays a list of notes including "Title2" with last modified date "2024/8/26 17:23".
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), click, "Title2"): Click to edit the note title. This action does not navigate to a new page, but allows the user to modify the title text "Title2" in the EditText field with id "me.writeily:id/edit_note_title".
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), long_click, "Title2"): Long click on the note title to open a context menu with options for text manipulation, including translate, cut, copy, paste, and share. The new menu has buttons for these actions with ids like "android:id/floating_toolbar_menu_item_text".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (528, 72), click, NULL): Click to share the note. Clicking this control opens the system share menu with options to share the note content through various apps.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (528, 72), longClick, NULL): Long click on the share button to open additional sharing options or perform a secondary share action. No new page or dialog appears, suggesting the long click may trigger an alternate sharing method or display a context menu with additional sharing options.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_preview, (624, 72), click, NULL): Click to preview the note content. The page changes to a preview mode with a WebView displaying the formatted note text and an "Edit" button (id: me.writeily:id/action_edit) replacing the "Preview" button.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_preview, (624, 72), longClick, NULL): Long press on the preview button to open additional options related to previewing the note. No new page or dialog appears, suggesting the long press action might not have a specific effect in this context.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 180), click, "Text2"): Click to edit the note content. Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but allows editing of the existing note content.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 180), long_click, "Text2"): Long click on the note content to open a context menu with options for translation, cut, copy, paste, and share. The menu appears with buttons for these actions, including an overflow menu for more options.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we have successfully completed the first four steps of the source test case. Let's proceed with the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL): Click on the back button to save the note and return to the previous page
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (), matches, "Title2"): Verify that the note title "Title2" is displayed in the list of notes
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (), matches, "Text2"): Verify that the note body "Text2" is displayed in the list of notes
~~~

This action corresponds to step 4 in the source test case, where we save the note. In the target app, it appears that clicking the back button saves the note and returns to the previous page. The assertions are to verify that the newly created note is visible in the list, which aligns with steps 5 and 6 of the source test case.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, I'll convert the test semantic descriptions into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the converted code:

···
d.click(0, 64)
assert d(text="Title2").exists()
assert d(text="Text2").exists()
···

Explanation:
1. The first action is a click on the back button using coordinates (0, 64).
2. The two assertions check for the existence of text elements "Title2" and "Text2" in the list of notes.

Note that I've used the device variable name 'd' as specified in the input. The code uses coordinates for the click action and text attributes for the assertions, as per the given requirements and preferences.

Based on the executed action sequence and the current state of the migration, here's the next step to continue the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, me.writeily:id/fab_expand_menu_button, (540, 1428), click, NULL):Click to expand the floating action menu to access the option for creating a new note
~~~

Explanation:
We have successfully created the first note with the title "Title2" and content "Text2", and verified its presence in the list. The next step in the source test case is to create another note. To do this, we need to start by expanding the floating action menu again to access the "create_note" button. This action corresponds to step 7 in the source test case, where a new note is initiated.
Based on the provided information, I'll convert the action into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the code:

···
d.click(540, 1428)
···

I've used the coordinates (540, 1428) provided in the action description to perform the click operation. This is the optimal choice as per your instructions to prefer coordinates when they are precise. The code will click on the floating action menu button to expand it, allowing access to the option for creating a new note.

Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case semantics, we are currently at step 7 of the source test case, which involves creating another new note. Let's proceed with the next step in the migration process.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, me.writeily:id/create_note, (540, 1116), click, NULL):Click on the "create_note" button to start creating a new note
~~~

This action corresponds to step 7 in the source test case, where we click on the "New note" action menu item to create another new note. In the target app, we're using the floating action button to achieve the same functionality.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d.click(540, 1116)
```

This code uses the coordinates (540, 1116) to click on the "create_note" button, which is the preferred method as per the requirements. The click action is performed using the device variable 'd' as specified in the device variable name.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL): Click to go back to the previous page, which is the main file listing page. The next page shows a list of files with a "Files" section header (id: me.writeily:id/notes_fragment_section_text) and a file entry "Title2" (id: me.writeily:id/note_title) with its last modified date.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), click, "标题"): Click to focus on the note title field for editing. No new page or elements appear as this action only activates the text input for the title.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), long_click, "标题"): Long click on the note title field to select text or bring up text editing options. No new page or dialog appears, as the current and next page JSONs are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (528, 72), click, NULL): Click to open the share options for the current note. The next page is not available, but typically this would open a system share dialog with various sharing options.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (528, 72), longclick, NULL): Long press on the share button to open sharing options. No new page appears, but a sharing menu or dialog is likely to be displayed with various sharing options.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_preview, (624, 72), click, NULL): Click to switch from edit mode to preview mode. The page changes to display a WebView for previewing the content, and the action_preview button is replaced with an action_edit button to allow switching back to edit mode.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_preview, (624, 72), long_click, NULL): Long click on the preview button to possibly reveal additional options or perform a specific action related to previewing the note content. No new page or dialog appears after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 180), click, NULL): Click to focus and enable text input in the note content area. No new page or widgets appear as this action activates the existing text input field.

Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case semantics, we are currently at step 8 of the source test case, which involves entering the title for the second note. Let's proceed with this step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), input, "Title1"): Enter "Title1" as the title of the new note
~~~

This action corresponds to step 8 in the source test case, where we input "Title1" as the title of the new note. The element ID and coordinates match the intention provided for the title input field on the current page.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d.click(144, 64)
d.send_keys("Title1")
···

This code first clicks on the EditText field at the coordinates (144, 64), which corresponds to the note title input field. Then, it sends the text "Title1" to that field, effectively entering it as the title of the new note.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL): Click to return to the previous page, which displays a list of notes including "Title1" and "Title2" with their last modified dates.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), click, "Title1"): Click on the note title field to edit the title. This action doesn't navigate to a new page but allows editing the title directly in the current note editing interface.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), long_click, "Title1"): Long click on the note title to open text selection options. A context menu appears with options for translating, cutting, copying, pasting, and sharing the selected text.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (528, 72), click, NULL): Click to share the note. Clicking this control opens a system share dialog or menu with options to share the note content through various apps.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (528, 72), longClick, NULL): Long click on the share button to open sharing options. The action does not navigate to a new page or generate new visible elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_preview, (624, 72), click, NULL): Click to preview the note content. The page changes to a preview mode with a WebView to display the formatted note content, and the action_preview button is replaced with an action_edit button.

Based on the provided information and the current state of the test migration, here's the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/note_content, (0, 180), input, "Text1"): Enter "Text1" as the body of the new note
~~~

Explanation:
1. We have successfully created two notes with titles "Title2" and "Title1" respectively.
2. For the second note (with title "Title1"), we have entered the title but haven't yet entered the body text.
3. The next logical step in the source test case is to enter the body text for the second note, which is "Text1".
4. The current page's intent description includes an action for the note content area, which matches our need to input the body text.

This action corresponds to step 9 in the source test case semantics. After this action, we'll need to save the note and verify its creation in the subsequent steps.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(0, 180)
d.send_keys("Text1")
···

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (0, 180) where the EditText is located, and then sends the keys "Text1" to input the text into the note content area.

ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL): Click the back button to return to the previous page, which shows a list of notes including "Title1" and "Title2", with a search button (id: me.writeily:id/search_button) and a floating action button (id: me.writeily:id/fab_expand_menu_button) for creating new notes.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), longClick, NULL): Long press on the back button to return to the previous page, which shows a list of notes including "Title1" and "Title2" with their last modified dates.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), click, "Title1"): Click to edit the note title. This action doesn't navigate to a new page but allows editing of the title text field.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, me.writeily:id/edit_note_title, (144, 64), long_click, "Title1"): Long click on the note title to open a context menu with options to translate, cut, copy, paste, and share the selected text. The menu appears with buttons for these actions and an overflow menu for more options.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (528, 72), click, NULL): Click to share the current note. This action opens the system's share menu, which is not captured in the Next Page JSON, but typically includes options to share via different apps or services.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_share, (528, 72), longClick, NULL): Long click on the share button to open the share options menu. The action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the current and next page JSONs are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_preview, (624, 72), click, NULL): Click to preview the note content. The page switches to a preview mode with a WebView displaying the formatted note content and an "Edit" button (id: me.writeily:id/action_edit) replacing the "Preview" button.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/action_preview, (624, 72), longClick, NULL): Long click on the preview button to potentially access additional preview options or settings. No new page or dialog appears, as the JSON for the next page remains the same as the current page.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, we can see that we have successfully created two notes with titles "Title2" and "Title1" respectively. The next step in the source test case is to save the second note and verify its display. Let's proceed with that:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 64), click, NULL): Click on the back button to save the note and return to the previous page
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (), matches, "Title1"): Verify that the note title "Title1" is displayed in the list of notes
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (), matches, "Text1"): Verify that the note body "Text1" is displayed in the list of notes
~~~

This action will save the second note and return to the list of notes. Then, we assert that both the title and content of the new note are visible in the list. This corresponds to steps 10, 11, and 12 in the source test case.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given scenario:

···
d.click(0, 64)
assert d(text="Title1").exists()
assert d(text="Text1").exists()
···

This code does the following:

1. Clicks on the back button using the provided coordinates (0, 64).
2. Verifies that a TextView with the text "Title1" exists in the list of notes.
3. Verifies that a TextView with the text "Text1" exists in the list of notes.

The code uses coordinates for the click action as specified in the requirements. For the assertions, it uses the text attribute since the text is confirmed in the input and no specific coordinates or IDs were provided for these elements.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully created two notes ("Title1" and "Title2") and are now at the point where we need to sort the notes by title. The next step in the source test case is to sort the notes. Let's proceed with this step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/title, (352, 98), click, "从设备导入"): Click to open the "Import from Device" dialog to access more options
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/title, (352, 194), click, "设置"): Click on "设置" (Settings) to navigate to the Settings page where we might find sorting options
~~~

I'm suggesting these actions because the current page's intent description doesn't show a direct "Sort" option. We might need to navigate through the settings to find the sorting functionality. If this action is successful, we'll need to look for sorting options in the Settings page in the next step.
Based on the provided information and requirements, I'll convert the given actions into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the code:

```
d.click(352, 98)
d.click(352, 194)
```

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the "从设备导入" (Import from Device) option at coordinates (352, 98).
2. Clicks on the "设置" (Settings) option at coordinates (352, 194).

I've used the coordinate-based approach as per the recommendation, and the device variable name is set to 'd' as specified.

ACTION (android.widget.ListView, me.writeily:id/notes_listview, (0, 176), click, NULL): Click to select a note from the list. This action updates the last modified timestamps of the notes, as seen in the "me.writeily:id/note_extra" fields of the next page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, me.writeily:id/notes_listview, (0, 176), longClick, NULL): Long click on the notes list view to select a note. This action does not navigate to a new page, but it likely triggers a selection mode or contextual action bar for the selected note, allowing operations like delete, share, or edit.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (0, 176), click, NULL): Click on the Files section to view or manage the list of files. The page remains the same with updated timestamps for "Title1" and "Title2" notes, indicating possible refresh of file information.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, "", (0, 176), longClick, NULL): Long click on the Files section to potentially trigger a context menu or selection mode for file management. No new page appears, but the last modification times of "Title1" and "Title2" have been updated to "2024/8/26 18:33".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/notes_fragment_section_text, (30, 206), click, "Files"): Click on the "Files" section header to open the file import dialog. The next page shows a file selection dialog with title "从设备导入" (Import from device) and various folder options like "data", "obb", "media", etc.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/notes_fragment_section_text, (30, 206), longClick, "Files"): Long press on "Files" section to open the import dialog. The dialog shows options to import files from device storage, with a title "从设备导入" (Import from device) and a list of directories to navigate, including "data", "obb", "media", "obj", "ANDROID.PERMISSION.TEST", and "hicore.a".
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (0, 246), click, NULL): Click on the list item to open the note titled "Title2". This action navigates to the note editing page for "Title2", which was last modified at 2024/8/26 18:35.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (0, 246), longClick, NULL): Long click on the list item to potentially open a context menu or perform an action. The page after long-clicking remains the same, but the last modification time of both "Title1" and "Title2" items has been updated to "18:36".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/note_title, (160, 278), click, "Title2"): Click on the note title to open the note. This action navigates to a new page showing a list of folders and files for importing, with options to select or cancel the import process.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/note_title, (160, 278), longClick, "Title2"): Long press on the note titled "Title2" to open a dialog for importing files from the device. The dialog contains a list of directories (e.g., Android, ColorOS, Music) and buttons for "取消" (Cancel) and "选择" (Select).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/note_extra, (160, 330), click, "最后修改：2024/8/26 18:26"): Click to view or edit the note. The next page shows an import dialog with title "从设备导入" (id: android:id/alertTitle), an empty folder message (id: me.writeily:id/empty_hint), and options to go back (id: me.writeily:id/import_header_btn) or select/cancel (ids: android:id/button1, android:id/button2).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/note_extra, (160, 330), long_click, "最后修改：2024/8/26 18:26"): Long click on the note's last modified date to open the import from device dialog. The dialog contains a title "从设备导入" (Import from device), an empty folder hint, a "返回上一级目录" (Return to parent directory) button, and "取消" (Cancel) and "选择" (Select) buttons.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/note_title, (160, 278), longclick, "Title2"): Long press on the note title to open a context menu for file operations. The next page shows an import dialog with options to navigate directories ("返回上一级目录" button) and confirm or cancel the import action.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, me.writeily:id/fab_expand_menu_button, (540, 1428), click, NULL): Click to open the import file dialog. The new dialog has a title "从设备导入" with id "android:id/alertTitle", a back button with id "me.writeily:id/import_header_btn", and a list of folders to choose from.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intentions, it appears that we have successfully created two notes ("Title1" and "Title2") and are now attempting to sort them. However, the sorting functionality seems to be different in this target app compared to the source app. Let's try to find the sorting option in the settings and proceed with the test case migration.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (), click, NULL):Click on the option to sort notes by title
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/note_title, (), matches, "Title1"):Verify that the note title "Title1" is displayed first after sorting
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/note_extra, (), matches, "Text1"):Verify that the note body "Text1" is displayed with "Title1"
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/note_title, (), matches, "Title2"):Verify that the note title "Title2" is displayed second after sorting
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, me.writeily:id/note_extra, (), matches, "Text2"):Verify that the note body "Text2" is displayed with "Title2"
~~~

This action attempts to find and click on an option to sort notes by title within the settings page. After that, we assert that the notes are displayed in the correct order after sorting. If this action is successful, we can consider the test case migration complete. If not, we may need to explore other options or adjust our approach.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, I'll convert them into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Since coordinates are not provided and are preferred, I'll use resource IDs and text attributes where applicable.

···
# Click on the option to sort notes by title
d(text="Sort by title").click()

# Verify that the note title "Title1" is displayed first after sorting
assert d(resourceId="me.writeily:id/note_title", index=0).get_text() == "Title1"

# Verify that the note body "Text1" is displayed with "Title1"
assert d(resourceId="me.writeily:id/note_extra", index=0).get_text() == "Text1"

# Verify that the note title "Title2" is displayed second after sorting
assert d(resourceId="me.writeily:id/note_title", index=1).get_text() == "Title2"

# Verify that the note body "Text2" is displayed with "Title2"
assert d(resourceId="me.writeily:id/note_extra", index=1).get_text() == "Text2"
···

Note: Since coordinates were not provided in the input, I used the text attribute for the click action and resource IDs with indexes for the assertions. If you have specific coordinates for these elements, please provide them, and I'll update the code accordingly.
