#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to click on the floating action button to initiate expense creation. Let's find the corresponding action in the target application.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/fab_expand_menu_button, (236, 556), click, NULL): Click to expand the menu to reveal options for adding expenses/income.
~~~

This action corresponds to the first step in the source test case, as it initiates the process of creating a new expense. The floating action button in the target app needs to be expanded first to reveal more specific options.
Based on the provided action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(236, 556)
···

This code uses the coordinates (236, 556) to perform a click action on the ImageButton that expands the menu. This approach is preferred as it directly uses the precise coordinates provided in the action description.

Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. The source test case starts with clicking a floating action button to initiate expense creation. In the target app, we've already expanded the menu, revealing options for adding expenses. The next logical step would be to select the option for adding a new expense.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/fab_new_expense, (244, 494), click, NULL): Click to add a new expense/income. This action opens a new page for adding an expense, which includes input fields for description (id: com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/description_edittext) and amount (id: com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/amount_edittext), a switch for expense type (id: com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/expense_type_switch), and a date selection button (id: com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/date_button).
~~~

This action corresponds to step 1 in the source test case, where we initiate the expense creation process. The next steps will depend on the result of this action and the new page that appears.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the described action:

···
d.click(244, 494)
···

This code clicks on the ImageButton with the resource ID "com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/fab_new_expense" at the coordinates (244, 494) to add a new expense/income. As per the requirements, I've used the coordinates for the click action since they are provided and precise.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. The source test case is currently at step 2, which involves clicking on the date picker button. Let's match this step with the available actions on the current page of the target app.

~~~

~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 of the source test case, where we click on the date picker button to open the date selection dialog. The purpose and functionality align well with the source test case, even though the exact widget type and ID may differ.
Based on the provided action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(167, 281)
···

This code uses the coordinates (167, 281) to click on the date button, which should open a date picker dialog for selecting the expense date. The coordinate-based approach is preferred as per the requirements, and it's the most direct way to interact with the specified UI element.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at step 2 of the source test case, which involves selecting a date for the expense. The target app has already opened the date picker dialog, so we can proceed with selecting a date. Let's continue with the next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, android:id/next, (242, 192), click, NULL): Click to move to the next month in the date picker to match the "Next month" action in the source test case.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in the source test case, where we click on the "Next month" button in the date picker dialog. After this action, we should be ready to confirm the date selection.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll continue with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've successfully opened the expense creation page.
2. We've clicked on the date picker and selected a date for the next month.
3. We've confirmed the date selection.

The next step in the source test case is to save the expense. However, we haven't entered any description or amount yet, which are typically required fields. Let's address this first:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/description_edittext, (30, 101), input, "Test Expense"): Enter a description for the expense.
~~~

This action will input a description for the expense, which is necessary before we can save it. After this, we can proceed with saving the expense.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(30, 101)
d(resourceId="com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/description_edittext").set_text("Test Expense")
···

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (30, 101) to focus on the input field, and then uses the resourceId to set the text "Test Expense" in the EditText widget.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case, it appears that we have successfully migrated steps 1 through 4 of the source test case. The next step in the source test case is to save the expense. Let's proceed with that action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/save_expense_fab, (236, 205), click, NULL): Click to save the expense and return to the main screen.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 5 in the source test case: "Click on the 'Save' button to save the new expense." After this action, we should be back on the main screen where we can verify if the expenses list is displayed.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code based on the given action:

```
d.click(236, 205)
```

This code uses the coordinates provided (236, 205) to click on the save expense button. Since coordinates are available and are the preferred method, we use them directly instead of using the resource ID or other attributes.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I will proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We have successfully added a new expense by clicking the floating action button, selecting a date, and saving the expense.
2. The last action performed was saving the expense, which should have returned us to the main screen.
3. The next step in the source test case is to verify that the text "Expenses" is displayed, indicating the presence of the expenses list.

Given this context, here's the next action we should take:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (), matches, "EasyBudget"): Verify that the main screen is displayed by checking for the presence of the "EasyBudget" title, which indicates we are on the main page where the expenses list should be visible.
~~~

This assertion checks if we have indeed returned to the main screen after saving the expense. The "EasyBudget" title is used instead of "Expenses" because, based on the current page's intent description, the main screen in the target app displays "EasyBudget" as the title.

If this assertion passes, we can consider the test case migration complete, as we have successfully added an expense and verified that we are back on the main screen where the expenses should be listed. However, to be thorough, we should wait for the result of this assertion before concluding the migration.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
assert d(text="EasyBudget").exists(), "The main screen with 'EasyBudget' title is not displayed"
···

This code checks for the existence of a TextView with the text "EasyBudget" on the screen. If it exists, the assertion passes, confirming that we are on the main page where the expenses list should be visible. If it doesn't exist, an AssertionError will be raised with the message indicating that the main screen is not displayed.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated most of the steps from the source test case to the target application. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next action:

1. We've completed the expense creation process, including selecting a date, entering a description, and saving the expense.
2. The last assertion in the source test case was to verify the presence of the "Expenses" text, indicating the expenses list.
3. In our executed actions, we've verified the presence of the "EasyBudget" title on the main screen.

To fully complete the test case migration, we should try to verify the presence of the expenses list or a newly created expense item. Since we don't have a direct "Expenses" text to check for, we can look for evidence of the expense we just created.

Here's the next step I propose:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (), contains, "Test Expense"): Verify that the newly created expense with the description "Test Expense" is visible on the main screen, indicating that the expense was successfully added and is now part of the expenses list.
DONE
~~~

This assertion attempts to find a TextView containing the text "Test Expense", which was the description we entered for the new expense. If this assertion passes, it confirms that the expense was successfully created and is visible in the list of expenses on the main screen.

The "DONE" statement indicates that we have completed the migration of all steps from the source test case to the target application, including the final verification step.
Based on the provided action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
assert "Test Expense" in d(className="android.widget.TextView").get_text()
···

This code verifies that there's a TextView on the screen containing the text "Test Expense", which confirms that the newly created expense is visible on the main screen.
