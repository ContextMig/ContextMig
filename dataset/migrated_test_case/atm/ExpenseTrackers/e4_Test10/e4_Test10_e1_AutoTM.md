Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with opening the navigation drawer, but the current page's intentions don't show a direct match for this action. However, we can see that there's an option to open a menu with additional options. Let's start with this action as it might lead us to the desired functionality.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (280, 28), click, NULL):Click on the More options button to open a menu with additional options
~~~
Based on the given action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

```
d.click(280, 28)
```

This code uses the coordinates (280, 28) to click on the More options button, which is represented by an ImageView. The action uses the device variable 'd' as specified in the device variable name.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with opening a navigation drawer, but the executed action in the target app shows clicking on a "More options" button. This suggests that the navigation structure might be different in the target app. Let's proceed with the next logical step based on the current page's intentions.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/title, (136, 41), click, "Adjust current balance"):Click to open the adjust current balance dialog
~~~

Explanation: 
1. The source test case is trying to navigate to an "Exchange Rates" section, which is not directly available in the current page's intentions.
2. However, we see an option to "Adjust current balance" which could be related to currency or financial management.
3. Clicking on this option might lead us to a page or dialog where we can find currency-related settings or exchange rates.
4. This action aligns with the overall goal of the test case, which is to interact with currency-related features.
Based on the provided action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(136, 41)
···

This code uses the coordinates (136, 41) to perform a click action, which should open the "Adjust current balance" dialog as described in the action.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the beginning of the test case migration. The executed actions so far have opened a menu and clicked on "Adjust current balance", which doesn't directly correspond to any steps in the source test case. However, this could be a necessary preliminary step in the target app before we can start adding an exchange rate.

Let's proceed with the next logical step based on the current page's intentions:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/balance_amount, (36, 219), click, "-16137.31"):Click to edit the current balance
~~~

This action allows us to interact with the balance amount, which might be necessary before we can access the exchange rate functionality. After this, we'll need to see if there are options to navigate to the exchange rate section or add a new exchange rate.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code for the given action:

···
d.click(36, 219)
d(resourceId="com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/balance_amount").set_text("-16137.31")
···

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (36, 219) to focus on the EditText field, and then uses the resourceId to set the text to "-16137.31".
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/alertTitle, (40, 139), click, "Adjust current balance"): Click on the title of the dialog. The action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the current and next page JSONs are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/alertTitle, (40, 139), long_click, "Adjust current balance"): Long click on the title of the dialog. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (16, 167), click, "Adjust how much you currently have on your account"): Click to view the message. Clicking this element does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (16, 167), long_click, "Adjust how much you currently have on your account"): Long click on the message to possibly copy or highlight the text. No new page or dialog appears, the current page remains unchanged.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/balance_amount, (36, 219), click, "-16137.31"): Click to edit the current balance. Clicking this control opens the keyboard for text input, allowing the user to adjust the balance amount.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/balance_amount, (36, 219), longClick, "-16137.31"): Long click to open text editing options. A new popup menu appears with options to "CUT", "COPY", "PASTE", and "More options".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (151, 285), click, "CANCEL"): Click the "CANCEL" button to dismiss the "Adjust current balance" dialog without making any changes. The app returns to the main calendar view showing the current month's expenses and balance.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (151, 285), longClick, "CANCEL"): Long click on the "CANCEL" button to dismiss the "Adjust current balance" dialog without making changes. The app returns to the main screen showing the calendar view, balance, and list of expenses.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the stage of adjusting the current balance in the target application. This doesn't directly correspond to any specific step in the source test case, which focuses on adding an exchange rate. However, we can proceed with this action as it might be a necessary step before accessing the exchange rate functionality in the target app.

Let's continue with editing the balance:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/balance_amount, (36, 219), input, "0"):Input a new balance of 0 to reset the current balance
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (228, 285), click, NULL):Click the OK button to confirm the balance adjustment
~~~

This action will reset the balance to 0 and confirm the change. After this, we should be back on the main screen, where we can proceed to look for options related to exchange rates or currency settings.
Based on the provided information, I'll convert the actions into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the code:

Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case, it appears that we have deviated from the original test flow. The source test case is about adding an exchange rate, while the executed actions are related to adjusting the current balance. Let's try to align with the source test case by finding a way to access the exchange rate functionality in the target app.

Given the current page's intentions, we don't see a direct option for exchange rates. Let's try to navigate to a menu that might contain this option.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (280, 28), click, NULL):Click on the "More options" button to open a menu with additional options
~~~
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d.click(280, 28)
```

This code clicks on the "More options" button located at coordinates (280, 28) to open a menu with additional options. The use of coordinates is preferred as per the requirements, and it's the most precise method for this action.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have already executed several steps related to adjusting the current balance in the target application. The next logical step in the migration process would be to proceed with adding an exchange rate, which corresponds to the source test case. However, the current page's intentions don't show any options related to exchange rates. We need to navigate to the appropriate section to add an exchange rate.

Let's try to find a way to access the exchange rate functionality:

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have navigated to the Settings page of the target application. Now, let's proceed with the next step of the test case migration.

The next step in the source test case is to add an exchange rate. However, in the target application, we don't see a direct option for managing exchange rates in the current Settings page. Instead, we see an option to change the currency. This suggests that the target application might handle currency conversion differently, possibly using a single base currency rather than managing multiple exchange rates.

Given this difference, we'll attempt to change the currency to match the intention of the source test case as closely as possible. We'll try to set the currency to USD (which was the "From Currency" in the source test case).

Here's the next action to take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (0, 116), click, NULL):Click to open currency settings
~~~

This action should open a dialog or submenu to change the currency. After this action, we expect to see a list of currencies to choose from. We'll need to confirm this in the next step and then select USD if it's available.
Based on the provided action and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(0, 116)
···

This code uses the coordinates (0, 116) to perform a click action, which opens the currency settings as described in the action. Since precise coordinates are provided, they are used as the preferred method for interaction.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears we are now in the Settings menu and have just clicked to open the currency settings. The next logical step in migrating the source test case would be to select a specific currency. Let's proceed with this step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (16, 132), click, "Change currency (NAD)"):Click to open the currency selection dialog
~~~

This action corresponds to step 4 in the source test case, where we click on the "From Currency" spinner to open the currency selection dropdown. In the target app, we're clicking on the "Change currency" option to open a similar dialog for currency selection.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(16, 132)
···

This code uses the coordinates (16, 132) to perform a click action, which should open the currency selection dialog. The coordinate-based approach is preferred as per the requirements, and it's the most precise method to interact with the specific UI element.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we are at the step of selecting a currency in the target application. This corresponds to steps 4 and 5 in the source test case, where the user selects the "From Currency". Let's proceed with selecting a currency that matches the source test case (USD) or an equivalent if USD is not available.

~~~
ACTION (android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/select_currency_recycler_view, (16, 106), click, NULL):Click to select USD (United States Dollar) as the currency
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/alertTitle, (40, 58), matches, "Select your currency"):Verify that the currency selection dialog title is correct
DONE
~~~

This action attempts to select USD as the currency, which aligns with step 5 in the source test case. The assertion is added to verify that we are indeed on the correct dialog for currency selection. If USD is not available or the selection fails, we may need to adjust our approach in the next iteration.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

```
d.click(16, 106)
assert d(resourceId="com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/alertTitle").get_text() == "Select your currency"
```

This code does the following:

1. Clicks on the specified coordinates (16, 106) to select USD (United States Dollar) as the currency.
2. Verifies that the currency selection dialog title is correct by checking the text of the element with the given resource ID.

The code uses coordinates for the click action as requested, and uses the resource ID for the assertion, as it's a more reliable method for verifying text content.
