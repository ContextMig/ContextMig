## e4's Test3 to e2

### Semantics of Source Test case
> Based on the provided Android test case, here's the corresponding function description following the specified format:
> 
> ```
> This test case is testing the expense addition functionality and verifying the total expense display.
> 
> The detailed process with serial numbers is as follows:
> 
> 1. ACTION (Button, R.id.btn_add_expense, (), click, NULL): Click on the "Add expense" button to open the expense addition screen.
> 
> 2. ACTION (EditText, R.id.et_title, (), input, "Shoes"): Enter "Shoes" as the title of the expense.
> 
> 3. ACTION (EditText, R.id.et_price, (), input, "69.99"): Enter "69.99" as the price of the expense.
> 
> 4. RETURN: Press the back button to return to the main screen.
> 
> 5. ASSERT (TextView, R.id.tv_total_expense, (), matches, "- 0 NON"): Verify that the total expense displayed is "- 0 NON" and the element is both displayed and enabled.
> ```
> 
> This description captures the main steps of the test case, including the actions performed and the final assertion. Note that the test case doesn't actually save the expense, which is why the total expense remains at 0 despite entering an expense amount.

Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. The source test case is currently at step 2, where we need to enter the title of the expense. In the target app, we don't have a separate title field, but we can use the description field for this purpose. Here's the next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description, (65, 158), click, "Add a description"): Click to input a description for the expense
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description, (65, 158), input, "Shoes"): Enter "Shoes" as the description of the expense
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 of the source test case, where we enter "Shoes" as the title. In the target app, we're using the description field for this purpose.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the provided actions:

```
d.click(65, 158)
d(resourceId="luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description").set_text("Shoes")

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've successfully clicked to open the expense creation page.
2. We've entered "Shoes" as the description of the expense.

The next step in the source test case is to enter the price of the expense. Let's match this to the appropriate action in the target app:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value, (61, 96), click, "0.00"): Click to edit the expense value
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value, (61, 96), input, "69.99"): Enter "69.99" as the price of the expense
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in the source test case. We're clicking on the expense value field and then inputting the value "69.99". This matches the functionality of entering the price in the source test case.
Based on the provided actions, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(61, 96)
d(resourceId="luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value").set_text("69.99")
···

This code first clicks on the expense value field using the provided coordinates, and then uses the resource ID to set the text to "69.99". This approach combines the use of coordinates for clicking and the widget ID for text input, as per the optimal choices mentioned in the requirements.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets

The action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the JSON data remains unchanged after the interaction.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense, (16, 335), longClick, "SAVE"): Long press on the SAVE button to save the expense. This action navigates to the main expenses page, which displays a total monthly expenses summary (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month) and a floating action button (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab) for adding new expenses.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Here's my analysis and recommendation:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense, (16, 335), click, "SAVE"): Click to save the expense details
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (), matches, "$261569.99"): Verify that the total expense displayed is updated to include the new expense
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've completed steps 1-3 of the source test case by opening the expense addition screen, entering the title "Shoes", and the price "69.99".
2. The next logical step is to save the expense, which corresponds to the "SAVE" button in the target app.
3. After saving, we should verify that the total expense has been updated. In the source test case, there was an assertion to check if the total expense was "- 0 NON". However, in our target app, we can see that there's already an existing total of $261500.00. Adding our new expense of $69.99 should result in a new total of $261569.99.
4. We're not using the RETURN action here because the save action likely automatically returns to the main screen, based on the description of the SAVE button's long-click action.

This approach maintains the functional similarity of the test case while adapting to the specific UI and flow of the target application.
Based on the provided actions, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(16, 335)
assert d(resourceId="luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month").get_text() == "$261569.99"
···

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the "SAVE" button using the provided coordinates.
2. Verifies that the total expense displayed is updated to "$261569.99" using the resource ID of the TextView.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated the first four steps of the source test case to the target application. The next step in the source test case is to verify the total expense. However, in the target application, we've already added an expense and verified that the total has been updated. Let's proceed with the final assertion to complete the test case migration.

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), matches, "$261569.99"): Verify that the total expense displayed is updated and correct after adding the new expense.
DONE
~~~

This assertion verifies that the total expense is correctly updated after adding the new expense. The coordinates (16, 126) are based on the information provided in the current page's intent description for the total month expense button.

We've completed all steps of the source test case:
1. We clicked to add a new expense (already executed)
2. We entered the expense description as "Shoes" (already executed)
3. We entered the expense amount as "69.99" (already executed)
4. We saved the expense, which implicitly returns to the main screen (already executed)
5. We verified the updated total expense (just added in this step)

Since all steps have been successfully migrated and executed, we can conclude the test case migration with DONE.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given assertion:

···
assert d(resourceId="luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month").get_text() == "$261569.99"
···

This code verifies that the total expense displayed in the TextView with the resource ID "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month" matches the expected value of "$261569.99". This assertion checks if the total expense has been correctly updated after adding a new expense.
