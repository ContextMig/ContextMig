#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided function description and the current page's intent description, I will start the test case migration. Since there are no executed actions yet, we'll begin with the first step of the source test case.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (280, 28), click, NULL):Click on the "More options" button to open a menu, which is similar to opening the navigation drawer in the source test case.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 1 of the source test case: "Click on the navigation drawer icon to open the drawer." Although the exact UI element is different (ImageView instead of ImageButton), the purpose is similar - to open a menu with additional options.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(280, 28)
···

This code uses the coordinate-based click operation as requested, which is the optimal choice according to the requirements. It clicks on the "More options" button at the specified coordinates (280, 28) to open a menu, simulating the action of opening the navigation drawer in the source test case.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (120, 28), click, NULL): Click to open the "Adjust current balance" option. This action does not navigate to a new page, but opens a menu with options including "Adjust current balance" and "Settings".
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (120, 28), long_click, NULL): Long click on the LinearLayout to open a context menu with options "Adjust current balance" and "Settings".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/title, (136, 41), click, "Adjust current balance"): Click on "Adjust current balance" to open a dialog for adjusting the current account balance. The new page displays an input field with id "com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/balance_amount" to enter the new balance amount, and buttons "CANCEL" and "OK" with ids "android:id/button2" and "android:id/button1" respectively.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/title, (136, 41), longClick, "Adjust current balance"): Long click on "Adjust current balance" to open a dialog for adjusting the current account balance. The dialog contains an EditText with id "com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/balance_amount" for entering the new balance, and two buttons: "CANCEL" (id: android:id/button2) and "OK" (id: android:id/button1) for confirming or canceling the adjustment.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/title, (136, 41), long_click, "Adjust current balance"): Long click on "Adjust current balance" opens the Settings page. The new page contains various settings options including "Change currency", "Set low balance warning threshold", "Become a premium user", and other app-related settings.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case was to open the navigation drawer, which seems to have been accomplished in the target app by clicking the "More options" button. Now, we need to proceed with the next step, which is selecting an option from the opened menu that corresponds to the income-related functionality.

Given the current page's intent description, the closest match to accessing income-related features appears to be the "Adjust current balance" option. Let's select this option to proceed with the test case migration.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/title, (136, 41), click, "Adjust current balance"):Click on "Adjust current balance" to open a dialog for adjusting the current account balance, which is the closest equivalent to accessing income-related features in the target app.
~~~

This action should open a dialog where we can potentially add or adjust income, which aligns with the goal of the source test case. After this action is executed, we'll need to evaluate the new page or dialog to determine the next steps in migrating the test case.
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(136, 41)
···

This code uses the coordinates (136, 41) to click on the "Adjust current balance" TextView. As per the requirements, using coordinates is preferred when they are precise, which is the case here.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/alertTitle, (40, 139), click, "Adjust current balance"): Click on the title of the dialog to adjust the current balance. The dialog remains open with options to edit the balance amount (id: com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/balance_amount) and buttons to cancel (id: android:id/button2) or confirm (id: android:id/button1) the adjustment.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/alertTitle, (40, 139), longClick, "Adjust current balance"): Long click on the title of the "Adjust current balance" dialog. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (16, 167), longClick, "Adjust how much you currently have on your account"): Long click on the message text to potentially copy or select the text. No new page or dialog appears after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/balance_amount, (36, 219), click, "100.00"): Click to edit the current balance amount. The page remains the same with an editable text field for entering the new balance.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/balance_amount, (36, 219), longClick, "100.00"): Long click on the balance amount field to open a text selection menu with options to Cut, Copy, and Paste. The menu appears with buttons for "CUT", "COPY", and "PASTE" along with a "More options" button.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (151, 285), click, "CANCEL"): Click the "CANCEL" button to dismiss the "Adjust current balance" dialog without making any changes. The app returns to the main calendar view with the balance and expense list visible.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (151, 285), longClick, "CANCEL"): Long click on the "CANCEL" button to dismiss the "Adjust current balance" dialog without making changes. This action returns to the main budget overview page, which displays a calendar view, balance information, and a list of expenses.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (228, 285), click, "OK"): Click the OK button to confirm adjusting the current balance. This action updates the balance to $100.00 and returns to the main page, which displays a calendar view and a list of expenses including the updated balance of $49,820.00.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (228, 285), longClick, "OK"): Long click on the "OK" button to confirm the adjustment of the current balance. This action navigates to the main page of the app, which displays a calendar view, current balance, and a list of expenses.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have opened a dialog to adjust the current balance. This is somewhat similar to the income addition functionality in the source test case. Let's proceed with the next step in the migration process.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/balance_amount, (36, 219), input, "500"):Enter "500" into the balance amount input field, which is similar to entering the income amount in the source test case.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 8 in the source test case, where we input the income amount. In the target app, we're adjusting the balance instead of adding income directly, but the concept of inputting a monetary value is similar.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d.click(36, 219)
d(resourceId="com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/balance_amount").set_text("500")
···

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (36, 219) to focus on the input field, and then uses the resourceId to set the text to "500" in the balance amount input field.

Based on the provided information, I'll continue the test case migration. Here's the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (228, 285), click, NULL):Click the "OK" button to confirm the adjustment of the current balance to $500.00
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (), matches, "Balance adjusted to $500.00"):Verify that a confirmation message "Balance adjusted to $500.00" appears
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already entered the amount "500" in the previous step, which corresponds to step 8 in the source test case.
2. The next logical action is to confirm this input, similar to step 9 in the source test case where the "ADD INCOME" button is clicked.
3. In the target app, we need to click the "OK" button to confirm the balance adjustment.
4. After confirming, we should verify that the action was successful. In the source test case (step 10), this was done by checking if a new table row was displayed. In our target app, we can check for a confirmation message that should appear after adjusting the balance.

This step combines elements from steps 9 and 10 of the source test case, adapting them to the specific UI and functionality of the target app. We're maintaining the core purpose of adding a monetary value and then verifying that the action was successful.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given actions:

```
d.click(228, 285)
assert d(text="Balance adjusted to $500.00").exists()
```

This code does the following:

1. Clicks the "OK" button at the specified coordinates (228, 285) to confirm the balance adjustment.
2. Verifies that a confirmation message "Balance adjusted to $500.00" appears on the screen.

The code uses coordinates for the click action as specified in the requirements, and uses the text attribute for the assertion as the text is confirmed in the input.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case, it appears that we have successfully migrated steps 8 and 9 of the source test case, which involve entering an income amount and confirming it. The next step in the source test case is to verify that the income has been added. Let's proceed with this verification:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/budgetLineAmount, (195, 359), matches, "$500.00"):Verify that the balance amount is displayed as $500.00, confirming the correct income amount was added.
~~~

This assertion checks if the balance amount is correctly displayed as $500.00, which corresponds to step 10 in the source test case where we verify that the income has been added.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the assertion:

···
assert d(resourceId="com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/budgetLineAmount").get_text() == "$500.00"
···

This code checks if the text of the element with the specified resource ID matches the expected value of "$500.00", verifying that the balance amount is correctly displayed as $500.00.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully added an income of $500 to the account balance. This corresponds to steps 8-11 in the source test case. Now, we need to focus on the earlier steps of the source test case, particularly adding an income source. Let's proceed with the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/fab_expand_menu_button, (236, 556), click, NULL):Click to expand the floating action menu to reveal options for adding income or expenses
~~~

This action aims to find an equivalent to the "ADD INCOME" button in the source test case (steps 3 and 6). By expanding the floating action menu, we should be able to access options for adding income in the target app.
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(236, 556)
···

This code uses the coordinates (236, 556) to click on the ImageButton that expands the floating action menu. Since precise coordinates are provided, this is the optimal choice for interacting with the element.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully added a balance of $500.00 to the account, which corresponds to steps 8-11 in the source test case. Now, we are on the "Add recurring expense/income" page, which allows us to add a recurring income similar to the "uber" income in the source test case (steps 5-7).

Let's proceed with adding a recurring income:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Switch, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/expense_type_switch, (30, 313), click, "OFF"):Toggle the expense type switch to change it from "Expense" to "Income"
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/description_edittext, (30, 101), input, "uber"):Enter "uber" as the description for the recurring income
ACTION (android.widget.Spinner, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/expense_type_spinner, (158, 184), click, "Every month"):Click on the interval spinner to select the frequency
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (158, 184), click, "Every month"):Select "Every month" as the recurring interval
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/save_expense_fab, (236, 233), click, NULL):Click the save button to add the recurring income
~~~

This sequence of actions should add a recurring income named "uber" with a monthly frequency, which corresponds to steps 5-7 in the source test case. After executing these actions, we should verify if the income was successfully added.
Based on the provided actions, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
# Toggle the expense type switch
d.click(30, 313)

# Enter "uber" as the description
d.click(30, 101)
d(resourceId="com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/description_edittext").set_text("uber")

# Click on the interval spinner
d.click(158, 184)

# Select "Every month" as the recurring interval
d(text="Every month").click()

# Click the save button
d.click(236, 233)
···

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully migrated most of the steps from the source test case. Let's continue with the next step:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/description_edittext, (30, 101), matches, "uber"):Verify that the description "uber" is displayed for the recurring income.
~~~

This assertion checks if the income source "uber" has been successfully added, which corresponds to step 7 in the source test case where we verify that a table row is displayed. In this case, we're directly checking the content of the description field.
Based on the provided input, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to verify the description "uber" for the recurring income:

···
assert d(resourceId="com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/description_edittext").get_text() == "uber"
···

This code uses the resourceId to locate the TextView element and checks if its text matches "uber". This approach is preferred over using coordinates when a unique resourceId is available, as it's more robust against potential layout changes.

ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/budgetLineAmount, (), matches, "$1,000.00"):Verify that the total balance has increased by $500.00, now showing $1,000.00
DONE
~~~
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified actions:

```
d.click(30, 170)
d(resourceId="com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/amount_edittext").set_text("500")
d.click(236, 233)
assert d(resourceId="com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/budgetLineAmount").get_text() == "$1,000.00"
```

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the amount input field using coordinates.
2. Enters "500" into the amount input field using its resource ID.
3. Clicks the save button using coordinates.
4. Verifies that the total balance shows $1,000.00 using an assertion.
