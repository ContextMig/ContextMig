#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with opening the navigation drawer, but the current page's intentions don't show a navigation drawer icon. Instead, we see an "Expenses" page with options to add new expenses. Let's start by trying to add a new income, which is similar to the source test case's goal.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab, (248, 568), click, NULL):Click on the floating action button to open the expense creation page
~~~

This action should open a new page for adding an expense, which we can potentially use to add income instead. We'll need to verify the contents of the new page before proceeding further.
Based on the provided action, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(248, 568)
···

This code uses the coordinates (248, 568) to click on the floating action button, which should open the expense creation page. Using coordinates is the preferred method as specified in the requirements, and it's the most precise way to interact with the element in this case.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to open the navigation drawer, but in the target app, we've already clicked on a floating action button to open the expense creation page. This suggests that the target app might have a different layout or navigation structure compared to the source app.

Let's proceed with the next logical step, which would be to add an income entry. In the source app, this was done by navigating to an "ADD INCOME" button, but in our target app, we're already on an expense creation page. We'll need to adapt our approach accordingly.

Here's the next step I propose:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value, (61, 96), input, "500"):Enter the income amount of 500 into the expense value field
~~~

This action corresponds to step 8 in the source test case, where we input the income amount. We're adapting it to the current context of the target app, where we're on an expense creation page instead of an income creation page. 

The reason for this adaptation is that the target app seems to handle both expenses and incomes in the same interface, unlike the source app which had separate flows for expenses and incomes. We're using the expense creation page to add an income entry.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(61, 96)
d(resourceId="luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value").set_text("500")
···

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (61, 96) to focus on the input field, and then uses the resourceId to set the text "500" in the expense value field.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the step of adding an income amount in the target application. The source test case is at step 8, where it enters "500" into the income amount input field. We have successfully executed two actions in the target app: clicking the floating action button to open the expense creation page and entering "500" into the expense value field.

The next logical step in the source test case is to save the entered income. In the target app, we have a "SAVE" button that can be used for this purpose. Here's the next action to take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense, (16, 335), click, "SAVE"):Click the SAVE button to save the expense entry
~~~

This action corresponds to step 9 in the source test case, where the "ADD INCOME" button is clicked to save the entered income amount. Although the button labels are different ("ADD INCOME" vs "SAVE"), their functions are similar in this context.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(16, 335)
···

This code uses the coordinates (16, 335) to click the SAVE button, which is the preferred method as per the requirements. The click action is performed using the device variable 'd' as specified in the device variable name.

The total amount displayed in the widget with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month" changes from $29000.00 to $31000.00.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month_description, (16, 96), long_click, "Total of month expenses"): Long click on the "Total of month expenses" text. This action doesn't navigate to a new page, but updates the total month expenses value from $29000.00 to $31500.00 in the widget with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), click, "$29000.00"): Click to view the expenses history.

Based on the provided information, I'll continue with the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've already opened the expense creation page.
2. We've entered the amount "500" into the expense value field.
3. We've saved the expense entry.

These actions correspond to steps 8 and 9 in the source test case, where we enter the income amount and save it. However, in the target app, we're adding an expense instead of income. 

The next step in the source test case (step 10) is to verify that a new table row is displayed. In our target app, we should verify that the new expense has been added to the list. Let's check if the expense is visible on the main page.

Here's the next step for the migration:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), matches, "$29500.00"):Verify that the total month expenses have increased by $500
~~~

This assertion checks if the total month expenses have increased by $500, which would indicate that our new expense has been successfully added. 

If this assertion passes, we can consider steps 8, 9, and 10 of the source test case as successfully migrated. The next step would be to verify the details of the added expense, which corresponds to step 11 in the source test case.
Based on the provided action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
assert d(resourceId="luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month").get_text() == "$29500.00"
···

This code verifies that the total month expenses displayed in the TextView with the specified resource ID match the expected value of "$29500.00". The assertion will pass if the text matches exactly, and fail otherwise.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully added an expense of $500 to the target application. This corresponds to steps 8 and 9 in the source test case, where an income amount of 500 was added. However, in the target app, we're dealing with expenses rather than income.

Let's proceed with the next step in the migration process:

ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), matches, "$29500.00"):Verify that the total month expenses have increased by $500
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), click, "$29500.00"):Click to view the expenses history
~~~

This action corresponds to step 10 in the source test case, where we verify that a new table row is displayed. In our target app, we're verifying the updated total and then clicking to view the expense history, which should show us the newly added expense.

The assertion is to confirm that the total month expenses have indeed increased by $500, which aligns with the functionality we're testing. The subsequent action to view the expenses history will allow us to verify that the new expense entry is visible, similar to checking for a new table row in the source test case.
Based on the provided actions, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
assert d(resourceId="luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month").get_text() == "$29500.00"
d.click(16, 126)
···

This code does the following:

1. First, it asserts that the text of the TextView with the resourceId "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month" is "$29500.00", verifying that the total month expenses have increased by $500.

2. Then, it clicks on the coordinates (16, 126) to view the expenses history. This action is performed using the coordinates as specified in the requirements.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have completed the steps related to adding an income/expense entry in the target application. The next step in the source test case is to verify that a table row is displayed, indicating that the income was added. Let's proceed with this verification in the target application.

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.ListView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/listView, (16, 175), isDisplayed, NULL):Verify that the expense list is displayed, showing the newly added expense
~~~

This assertion checks if the ListView containing the expenses is displayed, which would indicate that the new expense entry has been successfully added and is visible in the list. This corresponds to step 7 in the source test case, where a table row display is verified.
Based on the provided action and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to verify that the expense list is displayed:

···
assert d(resourceId="luankevinferreira.expenses:id/listView").exists(), "Expense list is not displayed"

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully added an expense of $500 to the target application and verified its addition. Now, let's continue with the next step of the test case migration, focusing on the income addition functionality as described in the source test case.

The next logical step would be to navigate to the income section of the application. However, the current page's intentions do not show a direct way to access an income section. We'll need to adapt our approach based on the available actions.

Let's try to navigate back to the main screen and look for an option to add income:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), click, NULL):Click on the "Navigate up" button to return to the main screen
~~~
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case semantics, it appears that we have already added an income/expense entry and verified its addition. The next step in the source test case is to add another entry with a specific name. Let's proceed with this step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab, (248, 568), click, NULL):Click on the floating action button to open the expense creation page
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description, (61, 156), input, "uber"):Enter "uber" as the description for the new expense entry
~~~

This action corresponds to step 5 in the source test case, where "uber" is entered as the income name. In the target app, we're using the expense description field for this purpose. After this, we'll need to save the entry and verify its addition in the next response.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(248, 568)
d.click(61, 156)
d(resourceId="luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description").set_text("uber")
···

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the floating action button at coordinates (248, 568) to open the expense creation page.
2. Clicks on the EditText field at coordinates (61, 156).
3. Sets the text "uber" in the expense description field using its resource ID.

Based on the provided information, I'll continue with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense, (16, 335), click, "SAVE"):Click the SAVE button to add the "uber" expense entry
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), matches, "$29500.00"):Verify that the total month expenses remain unchanged after adding the description
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already entered "uber" as the description for the new expense entry in the previous step.
2. The next logical step is to save this entry by clicking the SAVE button.
3. After saving, we should verify that the total month expenses haven't changed, as we've only added a description to an existing expense.
4. This corresponds to steps 5 and 6 in the source test case, where we enter the income name and click the ADD INCOME button.

The assertion is included to ensure that adding just a description doesn't affect the total expenses, which aligns with the verification steps in the source test case.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(16, 335)
assert d(resourceId="luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month").get_text() == "$29500.00"
···

This code does the following:
1. Clicks the SAVE button at the coordinates (16, 335) to add the "uber" expense entry.
2. Verifies that the total month expenses remain unchanged after adding the description by checking if the text of the element with the resource ID "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month" is "$29500.00".

Based on the provided information, I'll continue the test case migration. Let's analyze the current state and determine the next step:

1. We've already added an income of 500 and verified it.
2. We've added a description "uber" to an expense entry.
3. The next logical step in the source test case is to verify that a table row is displayed indicating the income was added.

However, in the target app, we're dealing with expenses rather than income. We need to adapt our approach accordingly. Let's verify the newly added expense entry:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), click, "$29500.00"):Click to view the expenses history
ASSERT (android.widget.ListView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/listView, (16, 175), isDisplayed, NULL):Verify that the expense list is displayed, showing the newly added expense
~~~

This action and assertion combination will allow us to check if the new expense entry (with description "uber") is visible in the list, which is analogous to verifying the table row in the source test case.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(16, 126)
assert d(resourceId="luankevinferreira.expenses:id/listView").exists()
···

This code does the following:
1. Clicks on the button at coordinates (16, 126) to view the expenses history.
2. Asserts that the ListView with the specified resource ID exists, verifying that the expense list is displayed.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided information and the executed action sequence, it appears that we have already completed several steps that correspond to the source test case. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next step:

1. We've already added an expense of 500 (which corresponds to adding income in the source test case).
2. We've added a description "uber" to an expense entry.
3. We've verified that these entries are visible in the expense list.

The next logical step in the source test case would be to verify the specific text of the added entry. In the source test case, this was done by checking for "500 MONTHLY". However, in our target app, we're dealing with expenses rather than income, so we need to adapt this step.

Let's verify the details of the most recent entry in the expense list:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value, (), matches, "500.00"):Verify that the most recent expense entry shows the correct amount of 500.00
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description, (), matches, "uber"):Verify that the most recent expense entry shows the correct description "uber"
~~~

This action will verify that both the amount and description of the most recently added expense are correct, which corresponds to step 11 in the source test case. If these assertions pass, we can consider the test case migration complete.
Based on the provided actions, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
assert d(resourceId="luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value").get_text() == "500.00"
assert d(resourceId="luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description").get_text() == "uber"
···

This code performs the following assertions:

1. It checks if the expense value displayed matches "500.00".
2. It verifies if the expense description shown is "uber".

Both assertions use the resourceId to locate the specific TextView elements and then compare their text content with the expected values.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated most of the steps from the source test case to the target application. Let's review the progress and determine the next step:

1. We've added an income/expense of 500.
2. We've added a description "uber" to an expense entry.
3. We've verified the total expenses and the presence of the new entries in the expense list.

The next step in the source test case is to verify that the text "500 MONTHLY" is displayed. However, in our target application, we don't see a direct equivalent to this. Instead, we can verify the presence of both the amount and description we've added.

Let's proceed with this verification:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value, (), matches, "500.00"):Verify that the most recent expense entry shows the correct amount of 500.00
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description, (), matches, "uber"):Verify that the most recent expense entry shows the correct description "uber"
DONE
~~~

This assertion checks for both the amount (500.00) and the description ("uber") that we've added, which corresponds to the final step in the source test case. 

I've included the DONE statement because we have now covered all the main functionalities from the source test case:
1. We've navigated to the appropriate screen (although through a different method).
2. We've added an income/expense amount.
3. We've added a description.
4. We've verified the additions in the expense list.

While the exact steps and UI elements differ between the source and target applications, we've successfully migrated the core functionality of the test case. If you feel there are any additional steps or verifications needed, please let me know, and I'll be happy to adjust the response accordingly.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
assert d(resourceId="luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value").get_text() == "500.00"
assert d(resourceId="luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description").get_text() == "uber"
···

This code performs the following actions:

1. Asserts that the expense value is "500.00" by checking the text of the element with the resource ID "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value".
2. Asserts that the expense description is "uber" by checking the text of the element with the resource ID "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description".

These assertions verify that the most recent expense entry shows the correct amount and description as specified in the input actions.
