#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with opening the options menu, but the current page's intentions don't directly show an options menu. However, there is a navigation drawer that might contain the settings option we need. Let's start with opening the navigation drawer:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), click, NULL):Click to open the navigation drawer, revealing menu items including HOME, HISTORY, INCOME, EXPENSES, and SETTINGS
~~~

This action should open the navigation drawer, which likely contains the "Settings" option we need for the next step of the source test case.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(0, 24)
···

This code uses the coordinates (0, 24) to click on the ImageButton that opens the navigation drawer. This approach is preferred as it's precise and doesn't rely on potentially changing IDs or text.

Based on the provided information, we are currently at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to open the options menu. However, in the target app, we have already opened the navigation drawer. Let's proceed with the next step, which is to access the settings.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (0, 240), click, NULL):Click on the "SETTINGS" option in the navigation drawer to access the app settings
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 in the source test case, where we click on the "Settings" option. In the target app, we're clicking on the "SETTINGS" item in the navigation drawer, which should lead us to the settings page.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(0, 240)
···

This code uses the coordinates (0, 240) to click on the "SETTINGS" option in the navigation drawer. As per the requirements, using coordinates is preferred when they are precise, which is the case here.

ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), click, NULL): Click to navigate back to the main page, which displays the today's budget information including elements with ids "com.kvannli.simonkvannli.dailybudget:id/textView3", "com.kvannli.simonkvannli.dailybudget:id/current_money", and "com.kvannli.simonkvannli.dailybudget:id/daily_amount".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click on the navigation button to return to the main page, which displays the daily budget, current money, and daily amount information.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (60, 38), click, "SETTINGS"): Click on the "SETTINGS" text to access the settings page. The page remains the same after clicking, containing options to change currency and rate the app.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (60, 38), long_click, "SETTINGS"): Long click on the Settings title. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the page content remains the same after the long click.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.kvannli.simonkvannli.dailybudget:id/current_currency_view, (62, 120), click, "Selected currency: $"): Click to view or change the current currency. No new page or dialog appears after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.kvannli.simonkvannli.dailybudget:id/current_currency_view, (62, 120), long_click, "Selected currency: $"): Long click on the current currency view. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes in the UI.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we are currently on the Settings page of the target application. The test case migration has progressed to step 3 of the source test case, where we are trying to access the currency settings. However, the target app seems to have a different structure for accessing currency settings. Let's proceed with the next step based on the current page's intentions:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.kvannli.simonkvannli.dailybudget:id/button3, (16, 165), click, "CHANGE CURRENCY"):Click to open currency selection dialog
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 and 4 of the source test case, where we are trying to access the currency settings and select a new currency. In the target app, it seems that instead of clicking on a list item, we need to click a specific "CHANGE CURRENCY" button to open the currency selection dialog.
Based on the given action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(16, 165)
···

This code uses the coordinates (16, 165) to perform a click action, which should open the currency selection dialog as described in the action. The coordinate-based approach is preferred as per the requirements, and it's the most precise method for interacting with the specific UI element.

#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (40, 151), click, "Selected: $"): Click on the title of the currency selection dialog. This action does not navigate to a new page or change the current dialog, as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (40, 151), long_click, "Selected: $"): Long click on the alert title. The action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets. The currency selection dialog remains open with the same options for currency selection.
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 235), click, "$"): Click to select the $ currency. The page remains the same, but the selected currency in the alert title may update.
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 235), long_click, "$"): Long click on the "$" currency option to potentially open additional options or settings related to this currency selection. The action does not navigate to a new page, but may trigger a context menu or additional functionality within the current currency selection dialog.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I will proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Here's my response:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 235), click, "$"):Click to select the $ currency in the currency selection dialog
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (40, 151), matches, "Selected: $"):Verify that the selected currency in the alert title is "$"
~~~

Explanation:
1. We have successfully navigated to the currency selection dialog, which aligns with step 4 of the source test case (clicking on the currency selection list).
2. The next logical step is to select a currency, which corresponds to the intention of changing the currency in the source test case.
3. We choose to click on the "$" currency option, as it's available in the current page's intentions and matches the purpose of changing the currency.
4. After selecting the currency, we add an assertion to verify that the selected currency is reflected in the alert title, which aligns with step 5 of the source test case (verifying the changed currency).
5. Note that we've adapted the assertion to match the specific UI elements and text of the target app, while maintaining the core purpose of verifying the currency change.

This response covers steps 4 and 5 of the source test case, adapting them to the specific UI and functionality of the target app. We're not marking it as DONE yet, as we need to ensure all steps of the source test case have been addressed.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(16, 235)
assert d(resourceId="android:id/alertTitle").get_text() == "Selected: $"
···

This code does the following:
1. Clicks on the CheckedTextView at coordinates (16, 235) to select the $ currency.
2. Verifies that the alert title text matches "Selected: $".

The code uses coordinates for the click action as specified in the requirements, and uses the resourceId for the assertion, which is the preferred method when the ID is available and unique.

ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 235), click, "$"): Click to select the $ currency. The page remains the same, but the selected currency in the alert title may update.
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 235), long_click, "$"): Long click on the "$" currency option to potentially open additional options or settings related to this currency selection. The action does not navigate to a new page, but may trigger a context menu or additional functionality within the current currency selection dialog.
