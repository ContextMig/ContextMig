Based on the provided function description and the current page's intent description, I'll start the test case migration process. Since there are no executed actions yet, we'll begin with the first step of the source test case.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), click, NULL):Click to open the navigation drawer, revealing options including Settings
~~~

This action corresponds to the first step in the source test case, which is to open the options menu. In the target app, we need to click on the ImageButton at coordinates (0, 24) to open the navigation drawer, which should reveal various options including Settings.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to open the options menu. Let's proceed with finding a similar action in the target app.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (72, 38), click, "Records"):Click on the "Records" text to view the financial records. The action does not navigate to a new page, but opens a navigation drawer with options like Accounts, Exchange rates, Results, Backup/Restore, Import/Export, and Settings.
~~~

This action should open the navigation drawer, which is similar to opening the options menu in the source test case. The next step would be to find and click on the "Settings" option.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the described action:

···
d.click(72, 38)

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with opening the options menu, but in the target app, we have already opened the navigation drawer. The next step in the source test case is to click on the "Settings" option. Let's proceed with this step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/design_menu_item_text, (16, 452), click, "Settings"):Click on the "Settings" menu item to navigate to the Settings page
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 in the source test case, where we click on the "Settings" option. In the target app, we're clicking on the "Settings" item in the navigation drawer, which should take us to the Settings page.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d.click(16, 452)
···

This code uses the coordinates (16, 452) to click on the "Settings" menu item. I've chosen to use coordinates as they are precise and available in the input. This approach is generally more reliable than using resource IDs or text, especially when dealing with menu items that might have dynamic IDs.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (0, 80), click, NULL):Click to open the Default account settings
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already navigated to the Settings page as per the last executed action.
2. The next step in the source test case is to click on an item in the settings list.
3. In the target app, we have a LinearLayout at coordinates (0, 80) which corresponds to the "Default account" settings option.
4. Clicking this should open the default account settings, which aligns with the next step in our source test case (clicking an item in the settings list).

This action aims to progress towards selecting a currency option, which is the ultimate goal of the source test case.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(0, 80)
···

This code uses the device variable 'd' to perform a click action at the coordinates (0, 80). This action will open the Default account settings as described in the input.

Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/summary, (16, 192), click, "AFN"):Click to open the default currency selection dialog
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already navigated to the Settings page and clicked on the Default account settings.
2. The next step in the source test case is to change the currency.
3. In the target app, we can see an intention that matches this functionality: "ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/summary, (16, 192), click, "AFN"): Click to open the default currency selection dialog."
4. This action will open a dialog with currency options, which aligns with step 3 in the source test case where a currency selection list is clicked.

This action progresses the test case migration by moving to the currency selection step, which is crucial for verifying the currency change functionality as described in the source test case.
Based on the provided action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

```
d.click(16, 192)
```

This code uses the coordinates (16, 192) to perform a click action, which should open the default currency selection dialog. The coordinate-based approach is preferred as specified in the requirements.

Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, android:id/select_dialog_listview, (16, 94), click, NULL):Click to select a currency from the list
~~~

Explanation:
1. We are currently at step 4 of the source test case, which involves selecting a currency from a list.
2. The executed action sequence shows that we have successfully navigated to the Settings page and opened the default currency selection dialog.
3. The current page's intent description provides an action for clicking on the currency list view, which aligns with our current step in the source test case.
4. Although the source test case specifies clicking on the second item, we don't have information about specific list items in the target app. Therefore, we'll use the general action to click on the list view, assuming it will select a currency.
5. This action maintains the functional similarity of selecting a currency, even if the exact widget interaction might differ slightly from the source app.
Based on the given action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(16, 94)
···

This code uses the coordinates provided (16, 94) to perform a click action. Since the coordinates are precise, it's the optimal choice to use them directly rather than using the resource ID or other attributes.

Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 94), click, "AFN"):Click to select AFN as the default currency
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/summary, (16, 192), matches, "AFN"):Verify that the selected currency (AFN) is displayed as the default currency
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've reached step 4 in the source test case, which involves selecting a currency.
2. The executed action sequence shows that we've already opened the currency selection dialog.
3. From the current page's intentions, we can see that clicking on a CheckedTextView with the text "AFN" will select AFN as the default currency.
4. After selecting the currency, we need to verify that the change has been applied, which corresponds to step 5 in the source test case.
5. We use an ASSERT to check if the summary TextView now displays "AFN" as the selected currency.

This action and assertion combination completes the currency selection process and verifies the change, aligning with the goals of steps 4 and 5 in the source test case.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(16, 94)
assert d(resourceId="android:id/summary").get_text() == "AFN"
···

This code does the following:
1. Clicks on the specified coordinates (16, 94) to select AFN as the default currency.
2. Verifies that the selected currency (AFN) is displayed as the default currency by checking the text of the element with the resource ID "android:id/summary".

Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/summary, (16, 192), matches, "AFN"):Verify that the selected currency (AFN) is displayed as the default currency
DONE
~~~

Explanation:
1. The last step in the source test case (step 5) was to verify the selected currency. This has been accomplished in the target app with the assertion we just made.
2. We have successfully migrated all steps from the source test case to the target app:
   - Opening settings (steps 1-2 in source) -> Navigating to Settings via the drawer
   - Selecting currency option (steps 3-4 in source) -> Opening default currency and selecting from list
   - Verifying selected currency (step 5 in source) -> Asserting the selected currency
3. As all steps have been migrated and verified, we can conclude the test case migration.

Therefore, I'm responding with the assertion to confirm the currency change and the DONE status to indicate that the entire test case has been successfully migrated.
Based on the provided input, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to verify the selected currency:

···
assert d(resourceId="android:id/summary").get_text() == "AFN"
···

This code checks if the text of the element with the resource ID "android:id/summary" matches "AFN", which verifies that the selected currency (AFN) is displayed as the default currency.
