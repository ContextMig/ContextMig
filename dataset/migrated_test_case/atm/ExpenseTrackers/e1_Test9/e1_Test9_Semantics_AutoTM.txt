Based on the provided Android test case, I'll generate a corresponding function description following the specified format:

```
This test case is verifying the currency change functionality in the app's settings.

The detailed process with serial numbers is as follows:

1. ACTION (OptionsMenu, , (), click, NULL): Open the options menu.

2. ACTION (TextView, R.id.title, (), click, NULL): Click on the "Settings" option in the menu.

3. ACTION (ListView, android.R.id.list, (), click, NULL): Click on the second item (index 1) in the settings list.

4. ACTION (RecyclerView, R.id.select_currency_recycler_view, (), click, NULL): Click on the second item (index 1) in the currency selection list.

5. ASSERT (TextView, android.R.id.title, (), matches, "Change currency (€)"): Verify that the title text of the selected currency option is "Change currency (€)".
```

Each action and assertion in this description corresponds to a step in the original test case, maintaining the sequence and purpose of the operations performed.
