#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with opening the navigation drawer, but the current page's intentions don't show a direct match for this action. However, we can see that there's an option to open a menu with settings access, which could be similar to opening a navigation drawer. Let's proceed with this action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (280, 28), click, NULL):Click on More options to open a menu with options for adjusting current balance and accessing settings
~~~

This action should open a menu that might contain the settings option we need for the next step in the source test case.
Based on the given action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d.click(280, 28)
···

This code uses the provided coordinates (280, 28) to click on the "More options" ImageView, which should open a menu with options for adjusting the current balance and accessing settings.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with opening the navigation drawer, but in the target app, we've already clicked on a "More options" button. Let's proceed with the next step that aligns with the source test case's intention of accessing the settings.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/title, (136, 41), click, "Adjust current balance"):Click to open the "Adjust current balance" dialog
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already opened a menu with options, which is similar to opening a navigation drawer in the source app.
2. The next step in the source test case is to navigate to the Settings menu.
3. In the target app, we don't see a direct "Settings" option, but we do have an "Adjust current balance" option, which could be part of the settings functionality.
4. By clicking on "Adjust current balance", we're progressing towards accessing app settings, which aligns with the intention of the source test case.

This action will open a dialog for adjusting the current balance, which might lead us to more settings options or allow us to proceed with currency-related settings in subsequent steps.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(136, 41)
···

This code uses the coordinates (136, 41) to click on the TextView with the text "Adjust current balance". Using coordinates is the preferred method as specified in the requirements.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have completed the first step of adjusting the current balance in the target application. Now, let's proceed with the next step of the test case migration, which is to navigate to the Settings menu.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (280, 28), click, NULL):Click on More options button to open a popup menu with options including "Settings"
~~~

This action corresponds to step 1 in the source test case, where we open the navigation drawer. In the target app, we're using the More options button to access the Settings menu, which aligns with the functional similarity principle.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d.click(280, 28)
```

This code uses the coordinate-based click method, which is the preferred approach as per the instructions. It will click on the More options button at the specified coordinates (280, 28) to open the popup menu containing options including "Settings".

ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (120, 28), click, NULL): Click on the "Adjust current balance" option to open the balance adjustment page. No new page appears, but a dialog or popup menu with options to adjust the current balance is likely to be shown.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (120, 28), long_click, NULL): Long click on the linear layout to open the options menu. The options menu contains "Adjust current balance" and "Settings" items.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/title, (136, 41), click, "Adjust current balance"): Click to open the "Adjust current balance" dialog. The dialog contains an EditText with id "com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/balance_amount" for entering the new balance, and two buttons: "CANCEL" (id: android:id/button2) and "OK" (id: android:id/button1) for confirming or canceling the adjustment.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/title, (136, 41), long_click, "Adjust current balance"): Long click on "Adjust current balance" to open a dialog for adjusting the current account balance. The dialog contains an EditText with id "com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/balance_amount" for entering the new balance, and buttons "CANCEL" and "OK" with ids "android:id/button2" and "android:id/button1" respectively.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided information, I can see that we have already executed several actions in the target application. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next step for the test case migration:

1. We've opened the options menu and adjusted the current balance.
2. We've reopened the options menu, likely to access the Settings.

The next step in our source test case is to navigate to the Settings menu. In the target app, we've already opened the options menu, so we should now select the "Settings" option.

Here's the next action I recommend:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (), click, "Settings"):Click on the Settings option to open the settings menu
~~~

This action attempts to click on the "Settings" option in the opened menu. We don't have specific id or coordinates for this element, so I've left those fields empty. The action should navigate us to the Settings page, which aligns with step 2 of our source test case.
Based on the given information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the specified action:

···
d(text="Settings").click()
···

This code uses the text attribute to locate and click the "Settings" option, as the coordinates were not provided and the ID was not specified. This approach is in line with the requirements to use text attributes when the widget's text is confirmed.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently in the Settings menu of the target application. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next step for the test case migration:

1. In the source test case, we have already completed the first two steps:
   - Opening the navigation drawer
   - Navigating to the Settings menu

2. The next step in the source test case is to click on the second item in the settings list view, which is likely the currency selection option.

3. In the target app, we need to find and click on the "Change currency ($)" option, which corresponds to this step.

Given this analysis, here's the next action to take:

Based on the provided information, we are currently at the step of selecting a new currency in the target application. The source test case is looking to select CAD (Canadian Dollar) as the currency. Let's proceed with the next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/select_currency_recycler_view, (16, 106), click, NULL):Scroll through the currency list to find and select CAD (Canadian Dollar)
~~~

This action corresponds to step 4 in the source test case, where we select the Canadian Dollar (CAD) from the currency list. In the target app, we're using the RecyclerView to scroll and select the desired currency. After this action, we should verify that the currency has been updated correctly.
Based on the provided action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to scroll through the currency list and select CAD (Canadian Dollar):

```
d(resourceId="com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/select_currency_recycler_view").scroll.to(text="CAD")
d(text="CAD").click()
```

This code does the following:
1. It scrolls the RecyclerView with the given resource ID until it finds an item with the text "CAD".
2. Once "CAD" is found, it clicks on that item.

Note: This approach is more reliable than using coordinates, as it will work regardless of the initial scroll position or screen size. However, if you specifically need to use the coordinates provided (16, 106), you can use this alternative:

```
d.click(16, 106)
d(resourceId="com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/select_currency_recycler_view").scroll.to(text="CAD")
d(text="CAD").click()
```

This will first click at the specified coordinates to ensure focus is on the RecyclerView, then perform the scroll and selection.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've already navigated to the Settings menu.
2. We've opened the currency selection dialog.
3. The next step in the source test case is to select CAD (Canadian Dollar) from the currency list.

Given the current page's intentions and the executed action sequence, here's the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/select_currency_recycler_view, (16, 106), click, NULL): Select CAD (Canadian Dollar) from the currency list
~~~

This action corresponds to step 4 in the source test case: "Select the 27th item in the currency selection list, which corresponds to CAD (Canadian Dollar)." 

We're using the RecyclerView to scroll and select the CAD option. The exact position of CAD in the list may vary, so we're not specifying a particular item number. Instead, we're relying on the app's ability to find and select the correct currency option.

After this action is executed, we should be ready to verify that CAD has been selected as the currency.
Based on the provided action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

```
d.click(16, 106)
```

This code clicks on the specified coordinates (16, 106) which should select the CAD (Canadian Dollar) from the currency list in the RecyclerView. The coordinate-based approach is used as per the requirements, which is the optimal choice when precise coordinates are available.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll analyze the current state of the test migration and determine the next step:

1. We've successfully navigated to the Settings menu and opened the currency selection dialog.
2. We've selected CAD (Canadian Dollar) from the currency list.

The next logical step would be to verify that the selected currency (CAD) is now displayed and enabled in the summary text view. Here's the appropriate action:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/summary, (16, 154), matches, "CAD"): Verify that CAD is now selected and displayed as the currency
DONE
~~~

This assertion checks if the currency has been successfully changed to CAD, which aligns with the last step of the source test case. If this assertion passes, we can consider the test case migration complete.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
assert d(resourceId="android:id/summary", className="android.widget.TextView").get_text() == "CAD"
···

This code verifies that the TextView with the resource ID "android:id/summary" has the text "CAD", which confirms that CAD is selected and displayed as the currency.
