#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with a long click on the first item in the expenses list. However, the current page's intentions don't show a direct match for this action. Instead, we should look for a way to view the expenses or records.

The most relevant action on the current page seems to be viewing the records. Let's start with this action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (72, 38), click, "Records"):Click on "Records" to view the financial records
~~~

This action should display a list of financial transactions including income and expenses, which aligns with the goal of the first step in the source test case.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(72, 38)
···

This code uses the coordinates (72, 38) to click on the "Records" TextView. Since the coordinates are provided and precise, it's the optimal choice to use them directly for the click action.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to long-click on an item in the expenses list. However, the executed action sequence shows that we have clicked on the "Records" tab, which is likely to display the list of financial transactions.

Given this context, the next logical step would be to interact with an item in the list of records. Since the source test case specifies a long-click action, we should attempt to perform a similar action on an item in the current list view.

Here's the suggested next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/list_view, (0, 80), long_click, NULL):Long click on an item in the list view to open a context menu for managing record items
~~~

This action attempts to replicate the long-click behavior from the source test case on the target application. By long-clicking on an item in the list view, we aim to open a context menu or options for further actions on the selected item, which aligns with the intention of the first step in the source test case.
Based on the provided action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the long click action:

···
d.long_click(0, 80, 1)
···

This code performs a long click at the coordinates (0, 80) for 1 second, which should open the context menu for managing record items in the list view.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the beginning of the test case migration. The first two steps of the source test case involve interacting with the expense list. Let's proceed with the next action that aligns with the source test case's intention.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.FrameLayout, , (0, 273), long_click, NULL):Long click on a record item to open options menu for editing or deleting the record
~~~

This action corresponds to step 1 of the source test case: "Long click on the first item in the expenses list." We're using the FrameLayout that contains the record item, as it's the closest match to the RecyclerView item in the source app. The long-click action should open a context menu or options for the selected record, which aligns with the next step in the source test case.
Based on the provided action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform a long click on the specified coordinates:

···
d.long_click(0, 273, 1)
···

This code uses the device variable 'd' as specified, and performs a long click at the coordinates (0, 273) for 1 second, which should open the options menu for editing or deleting the record.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information and the executed action sequence, it appears that we are currently at the stage of editing or deleting a record in the target application. This corresponds to steps 1 and 2 in the source test case, where a long click is performed on an item in the expenses list, followed by selecting an option from the popup menu.

To continue the migration, we should look for an action that allows us to edit or delete the selected record. Since the source test case doesn't specify whether it's an edit or delete action, we'll assume it's an edit action to align with the overall goal of the test case (adding a recurring expense).

Here's the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/tv_title, (16, 296), click, "Entertainment"):Click to edit the expense record
~~~

This action should open the edit expense page, which aligns with the next steps in the source test case where we'll be adding a new recurring expense. By clicking on the title of the expense, we're likely to open the edit page for that specific expense, which should provide similar functionality to adding a new expense.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(16, 296)
···

This code uses the coordinates (16, 296) to click on the TextView with the text "Entertainment". Since coordinates are provided and they are precise, we use them directly for the click action as per the requirements.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the step of editing an existing expense record in the target application. This corresponds to step 2 in the source test case, where we are interacting with a selected item from the expenses list. Let's proceed with the next appropriate action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_price, (16, 164), click, "45.00"):Click on the price input field to edit the expense amount
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already opened the edit expense page, which aligns with the source test case's intention of modifying an existing expense.
2. The next logical step is to edit the amount of the expense, which corresponds to step 6 in the source test case where we input the amount.
3. Although the source test case uses "100" as the amount, we'll keep the existing value "45.00" for now, as we're just focusing on the action of clicking the field to prepare for editing.
4. This action will allow us to modify the expense amount in the next step, maintaining the flow of the test case while adapting to the target application's interface.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

```
d.click(16, 164)
d(resourceId="com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_price").set_text("45.00")
```

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (16, 164) to focus on the price input field, and then uses the resourceId to set the text to "45.00" in the input field.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently in the process of editing an existing expense record in the target application. Let's analyze the current state and determine the next action to take:

1. We have already navigated to the Records page.
2. We have long-clicked on a list item to open a context menu.
3. We have clicked on the "Entertainment" expense to edit it.
4. We have clicked on the price input field.

The next logical step in the source test case is to input the amount for the recurring expense. In the source test case, the amount was 100, but in the target app, we see that the current amount is 45.00. Let's proceed with updating this amount to match the source test case.

Here's the next action to take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_price, (16, 164), input, "100"):Enter "100" as the new amount for the expense
~~~

This action corresponds to step 6 in the source test case: "Enter "100" as the amount for the recurring expense." We're using the same input field that was clicked in the previous action to enter the new amount.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(16, 164)
d(resourceId="com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_price").set_text("100")
···

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (16, 164) to focus on the EditText widget, and then uses the resourceId to set the text "100" as the new amount for the expense.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've successfully navigated to the Records page.
2. We've long-clicked on a list item to open a context menu.
3. We've clicked on an item (presumably "Entertainment") to edit it.
4. We've edited the price from 45.00 to 100.

The next logical step in our source test case would be to save the edited expense. Let's look for an action that corresponds to saving or confirming the edit.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/action_done, (272, 28), click, NULL):Click to save the edited expense and return to the Records page
~~~

This action should save the edited expense with the new amount of 100. After this action, we should verify that the change has been applied correctly.
Based on the provided action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d.click(272, 28)
···

This code uses the coordinates (272, 28) to click on the "action_done" TextView, which will save the edited expense and return to the Records page. I've used the coordinate-based approach as requested, since precise coordinates were provided in the action description.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll continue the test case migration. Here's the next step:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/tv_price, (208, 281), isDisplayed, "- 100"):Verify that the expense amount has been updated to 100
~~~

This assertion checks if the expense amount has been successfully updated to 100 after the edit operation. It corresponds to step 8 in the source test case, which verifies that the recurring expense has been added. In this case, we're verifying that the expense amount has been updated correctly.

The next step in the source test case is to verify that the recurring indicator is displayed. However, based on the current page's intentions, there doesn't seem to be a direct equivalent for a recurring indicator. We might need to adapt this step or skip it if the target app doesn't have a similar feature.

Let me know if you want me to proceed with the next step or if you have any other instructions.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the assertion:

···
assert d(resourceId="com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/tv_price", text="- 100").exists()
···

This code checks if the TextView with the specified resource ID and text "- 100" exists on the screen, effectively verifying that the expense amount has been updated to 100.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've already edited an existing expense, changing its amount from 45 to 100.
2. The next step in the source test case is to add a new recurring expense.

However, the target app doesn't seem to have a direct "add recurring expense" option. Instead, we'll need to add a regular expense and then look for a way to make it recurring if possible.

Here's the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/btn_add_expense, (160, 589), click, "ADD EXPENSE"):Click to open the Add expense page to add a new expense
~~~

This action corresponds to step 4 in the source test case (clicking on the button to add a new recurring expense). Although it's not specifically for recurring expenses, it's the closest match in functionality. After this, we'll proceed with entering the expense details in the next steps.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(160, 589)
···

This code uses the coordinates (160, 589) to click on the "ADD EXPENSE" button, which will open the Add expense page to add a new expense. Since coordinates are provided and they are precise, we use them as the preferred method for interaction.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have already completed several steps of the test case migration. Let's continue with the next step in the source test case.

The next step in the source test case is:
5. ACTION (EditText, R.id.description_edittext, (), input, "Entertainment"): Enter "Entertainment" as the description for the recurring expense.

In the target app, we are currently on the "Add expense" page. We need to enter "Entertainment" as the title of the expense. Here's the appropriate action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_title, (16, 221), input, "Entertainment"):Enter "Entertainment" as the title for the expense
~~~

This action corresponds to entering the description in the source test case. In the target app, we're using the title field to achieve the same purpose.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(16, 221)
d(resourceId="com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_title").set_text("Entertainment")
···

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (16, 221) to focus on the EditText field, and then uses the resource ID to set the text "Entertainment" as the title for the expense.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have already completed several steps of the test case migration. Let's continue with the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_category, (16, 278), click, NULL):Click to focus on the category input field for the new expense
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_category, (16, 278), input, "Entertainment"):Enter "Entertainment" as the category for the new expense
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already added a new expense with the title "Entertainment", which corresponds to step 5 in the source test case.
2. The next logical step is to enter the category for the expense. In the target app, we need to explicitly enter the category, while in the source app, it might have been automatically set or not required.
3. We first click on the category input field to focus on it, then input "Entertainment" as the category. This aligns with the purpose of categorizing the expense as described in the source test case.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given actions:

```
d.click(16, 278)
d(resourceId="com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_category").set_text("Entertainment")
```

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the coordinates (16, 278) to focus on the category input field.
2. Uses the resourceId to set the text "Entertainment" in the category input field.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently in the process of adding a new recurring expense in the target application. Let's proceed with the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_price, (16, 164), click, NULL):Click to focus on the price input field for entering the expense amount
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_price, (16, 164), input, "100"):Enter "100" as the amount for the recurring expense
~~~

Explanation:
1. We have already entered the description ("Entertainment") and category for the new expense, which corresponds to step 5 in the source test case.
2. The next step in the source test case (step 6) is to enter the amount "100" for the recurring expense.
3. In the target app, we first need to click on the price input field to focus on it, and then we can enter the amount.
4. These actions correspond to the intentions provided for the current page, specifically the actions related to the price input field with id "com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_price".

After executing these actions, we should be ready to save the new expense in the next step.
Based on the provided actions, I'll convert them into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the code:

```
d.click(16, 164)
d(resourceId="com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_price").set_text("100")
```

This code first clicks on the price input field using the provided coordinates (16, 164) to focus on it. Then, it uses the resource ID of the EditText to set the text to "100" for the recurring expense amount.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have already completed several steps of the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next action:

1. We have already added an expense with the title "Entertainment", category "Entertainment", and amount "100".
2. The source test case involves adding a recurring expense, but we haven't seen any option for making the expense recurring in the target app.
3. The next logical step would be to save this expense and verify if it has been added successfully.

Given this analysis, here's the next action I recommend:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/action_done, (272, 28), click, NULL):Click to add the expense and return to the Records page
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/tv_title, (16, 296), isDisplayed, "Entertainment"):Verify that the newly added expense with title "Entertainment" is displayed in the list
DONE
~~~

This action will save the new expense and then verify if it appears in the list of expenses. Note that we haven't been able to make this a recurring expense as in the source test case, because the target app doesn't seem to have this feature based on the provided intentions. We're focusing on the core functionality of adding an expense with the correct details.
Based on the provided actions, I'll convert them into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the corresponding code:

```
d.click(272, 28)
assert d(resourceId="com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/tv_title", text="Entertainment").exists()
```

This code does the following:

1. Clicks on the coordinate (272, 28) to add the expense and return to the Records page.
2. Verifies that the newly added expense with the title "Entertainment" is displayed in the list by checking if an element with the specified resource ID and text exists.
