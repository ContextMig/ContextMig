## e3's Test9 to e2

### Semantics of Source Test case
> This test case is testing the navigation and tab selection functionality in an expense tracker application. Here's the corresponding function description following the specified format:
> 
> ```
> 1. ACTION (ImageButton, , (), click, NULL):Click on the navigation drawer button to open the side menu.
> 
> 2. ACTION (TextView, R.id.navigation_drawer, (), click, NULL):Select the second item in the navigation drawer.
> 
> 3. ACTION (LinearLayout, R.id.tabsLayout, (), click, NULL):Click on the second tab in the tab layout.
> 
> 4. ACTION (LinearLayout, R.id.tabsLayout, (), click, NULL):Click on the third tab in the tab layout.
> ```
> 
> This test case performs the following actions:
> 
> 1. Opens the navigation drawer by clicking on the hamburger menu icon.
> 2. Selects the second item in the navigation drawer, likely navigating to a different screen or section of the app.
> 3. Clicks on the second tab in a tab layout, presumably switching to a different view or category within the current screen.
> 4. Clicks on the third tab in the same tab layout, again switching to a different view or category.
> 
> The test case appears to be verifying the basic navigation and tab switching functionality of the expense tracker application.

### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), click, "Expenses"): Click on the "Expenses" text to navigate to the expenses page. The page remains unchanged after this action, suggesting it may be the title of the current page and not an interactive element.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), long_click, "Expenses"): Long click on the "Expenses" text to perform an action. The long click does not navigate to a new page or create new visible elements.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (260, 24), click, NULL): Click on More options to open a menu. The menu appears with an item "* ALL *" with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/title".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (260, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click to open more options menu. The action does not navigate to a new page or create new visible elements, suggesting the menu might be a popup or overlay not captured in the JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month_description, (16, 96), click, "Total of month expenses"): Click on the total month description. This action does not navigate to a new page or show new widgets, as the Current Page JSON and Next Page JSON are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month_description, (16, 96), long_click, "Total of month expenses"): Long click on the total month description. This action does not lead to any visible changes in the UI or navigation to a new page.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), click, "$0.00"): Click to view the expenses history. The next page shows a monthly expense history view with navigation buttons (prev_button, next_button) and a total expense display (total_history).
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), long_click, "$0.00"): Long click on the total month expenses button to view the expenses history. This action navigates to a new page with a title "Expenses history", showing the current month's expenses and navigation buttons for previous and next months.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab, (248, 568), click, NULL): Click to open the expense creation page. The new page contains input fields for expense value (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value), description (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description), date picker (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/date_picker), expense type spinner (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_type), and a save button (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense).
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab, (248, 568), longClick, NULL): Long click to open the expense creation page. The new page contains input fields for expense value (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value), description (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description), date picker (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/date_picker), expense type spinner (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_type), and a save button (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense).

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with opening the navigation drawer, but the current page's intent description doesn't show a navigation drawer button. Instead, it shows we're already on an "Expenses" page. Let's try to find an equivalent action that matches the purpose of the first step in the source test case.

The closest match seems to be opening the options menu, which might contain navigation options. Here's the suggested action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (260, 24), click, NULL):Click on More options to open a menu, which may contain navigation options similar to a navigation drawer
~~~

This action attempts to open a menu that might contain navigation options, similar to what a navigation drawer would provide in the source application.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code for the given action:

···
d.click(260, 24)
···

This code uses the coordinates (260, 24) to click on the "More options" ImageView, which should open a menu containing navigation options. The use of coordinates is preferred as per the requirements, and it's the most precise way to interact with the specific element in this case.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (120, 24), click, NULL): Click to open the category selection menu. Clicking this control does not navigate to a new page, but likely triggers a dropdown or dialog to select expense categories.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (120, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click on the LinearLayout containing "* ALL *" text. This action does not navigate to a new page or show new widgets, suggesting it might trigger a contextual action or have no visible effect in the current UI state.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/title, (136, 37), click, "* ALL *"): Click to open the expense category selection menu. The page remains the same after clicking, with the total month expenses view (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month) and add expense button (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab) still visible.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/title, (136, 37), long_click, "* ALL *"): Long click to open a context menu or perform an action related to the "* ALL *" category. The action does not navigate to a new page, but may trigger additional options or functionality within the current view.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Here's my analysis and recommendation:

1. We've successfully clicked on the "More options" menu, which might serve a similar purpose to the navigation drawer in the source app.

2. The next step in the source test case is to select the second item in the navigation drawer. However, we don't have direct information about the contents of the opened menu in the target app.

3. Given that we're in an expense tracker app and the current page shows a category selection menu with "* ALL *" as an option, it's likely that we're already on a page showing expenses or transactions.

4. The source test case then moves to interacting with tabs, but we don't see any tab-like structures in the current page's intentions.

5. Instead, we see options to interact with the category selection, which could be functionally similar to switching between different views of expenses.

Given this analysis, I suggest we proceed with selecting a category, which could be analogous to selecting a tab in the source app. Here's the proposed next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/title, (136, 37), click, "* ALL *"):Click to open the expense category selection menu to view all expenses, similar to switching to a comprehensive view in the source app
~~~

This action aims to open the category selection menu, which could reveal more options or change the view of expenses, similar to how switching tabs works in the source app. After this action is executed, we'll need to reassess the new state of the app to determine the next appropriate step in the migration process.
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(136, 37)
···

This code uses the coordinates (136, 37) to perform a click action, which should open the expense category selection menu to view all expenses. This approach is preferred as it uses precise coordinates, which is the optimal choice according to the requirements.

ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), long_click, "$0.00"): Long click on the total month expenses button to view the expenses history. This action navigates to a new page with a title "Expenses history", showing the current month's expenses and navigation buttons for previous and next months.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab, (248, 568), click, NULL): Click to open the expense creation page. The new page contains input fields for expense value (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value), description (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description), date picker (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/date_picker), expense type spinner (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_type), and a save button (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense).
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab, (248, 568), longClick, NULL): Long click to open the expense creation page.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears we are currently at the beginning of the test case migration. Let's proceed with the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month_description, (16, 96), click, "Total of month expenses"):Click on the total month description to view expenses, which may correspond to selecting a specific view or category in the source app
~~~

This action is chosen because:

1. We've already opened a menu (similar to the navigation drawer in the source app) and selected an option ("* ALL *"), which could be seen as equivalent to the first two steps in the source test case.

2. The next logical step would be to interact with the main content of the page, which in this case is the total month expenses. This action could be similar to selecting a specific tab or view in the source app.

3. Although this doesn't exactly match clicking on a tab as in the source test case, it's functionally similar in that it's likely to change the view or focus of the expenses being displayed.

We'll need to see the result of this action to determine our next step in the migration process.
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(16, 96)
···

This code uses the coordinates (16, 96) to perform a click action, which should select the total month description to view expenses. This approach is preferred as it directly uses the precise coordinates provided in the action description.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have completed the first step of the source test case, which was to open the navigation drawer. The executed actions in the target app suggest that we've accessed a menu (possibly similar to a navigation drawer) and selected an option to view all expenses. Now, we need to proceed with the next step of the source test case.

The next step in the source test case is to select the second item in the navigation drawer. However, in the target app, we've already selected an option from the menu. Let's try to match the next step in the source test case, which is to click on the second tab in the tab layout.

Given the current page's intentions, we don't see a direct equivalent to tabs. However, we can try to navigate to a different view of expenses, which might be functionally similar to switching tabs. The most appropriate action seems to be viewing the expenses history.

Here's the next suggested action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), click, "$0.00"):Click to view the expenses history, which may be equivalent to switching to a different tab or view in the source app
~~~

This action should navigate to the expenses history page, which could be considered analogous to switching to a different tab in the source application. We'll need to see the result of this action to determine our next steps in the test case migration.
Based on the given action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the click action:

```
d.click(16, 126)
```

This code uses the coordinate-based approach as requested, clicking on the specified position (16, 126) which corresponds to the total month button. This action should open the expenses history or switch to a different tab/view in the app.

ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), click, NULL): Click to navigate back to the main Expenses page, which displays the total monthly expenses ($0.00) and includes a floating action button (FAB) with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), longClick, NULL): Long click on the navigate up button to return to the main Expenses page, which displays the total month expenses and has a floating action button with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (72, 38), click, "Expenses history"): Click on "Expenses history" to view the expenses history page. The page remains the same after clicking, showing the expenses history with a month selector (luankevinferreira.expenses:id/month_expense) and total expenses (luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_history).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, "", (72, 38), long_click, "Expenses history"): Long click on the "Expenses history" text to potentially reveal additional options or actions related to the expenses history. No new page or dialog appears after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/prev_button, (16, 96), click, NULL): Click to navigate to the previous month (July) in the expenses history. The month text changes from "August" to "July" in the widget with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/month_expense".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/prev_button, (16, 96), long_click, NULL): Long click on the previous button to navigate to the previous month (July) in the expenses history. The month displayed in the "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/month_expense" TextView changes from "August" to "July".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/month_expense, (74, 96), click, "August"): Click to potentially change the displayed month for expense history. No new page or widgets appear after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/month_expense, (74, 96), long_click, "August"): Long click on the month display to potentially open a month selection dialog or menu. However, the action does not result in any visible changes to the page or new elements appearing.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/next_button, (247, 96), click, NULL): Click to navigate to the next month (September) in the expenses history. The page updates with the new month displayed in the "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/month_expense" TextView.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/next_button, (247, 96), longClick, NULL): Long click on the 'Next' button to advance to the next month (September) in the expenses history view, updating the displayed month and potentially the total expenses for that month.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (21, 190), click, "Total"): Click on the "Total" label. No change in page or new widgets appear, as the next page JSON is identical to the current page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (21, 190), long_click, "Total"): Long click on the "Total" text to potentially show options or details related to the total expenses. No new page or dialog appears after this action, as the JSON for the next page remains the same as the current page.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_history, (71, 190), click, "$0.00"): Click on the total history amount. This action does not navigate to a new page or show new widgets, as the current and next page JSONs are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_history, (71, 190), long_click, "$0.00"): Long click on the total expense amount. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes in the UI.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have already executed some actions that partially correspond to the source test case. Let's continue with the next step in the migration process.

The next logical step in the source test case is to click on the third tab in the tab layout. However, in the target app, we don't see a direct equivalent of a tab layout. Instead, we have a page showing the expenses history with options to navigate between months.

Given the current state and available actions, the most appropriate next step would be to interact with the month navigation feature, which could be considered functionally similar to switching between tabs in the source app.

Here's the suggested next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/next_button, (247, 96), click, NULL):Click to navigate to the next month (September) in the expenses history, simulating the action of moving to a different view or category as in the source test case
~~~

This action maintains the spirit of the source test case by navigating to a different view of the expenses data, similar to switching tabs in the original app.
Based on the given action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(247, 96)
···

This code uses the coordinates (247, 96) to click on the ImageButton that navigates to the next month (September) in the expenses history. This approach is optimal as it directly uses the provided coordinates, which is the preferred method according to the requirements.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have navigated to the expenses history page and are currently viewing the expenses for September. The next step in the source test case is to click on the third tab in the tab layout. However, in the target app, we don't see a direct equivalent of tabs. Instead, we can navigate through different months, which could be considered analogous to switching between different views or categories.

Given this context, the next logical step would be to navigate to the next month (October) to simulate moving to a different view or category. This action aligns with the intent of the source test case to switch between different views.

Here's the proposed next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/next_button, (247, 96), click, NULL):Click to navigate to the next month (October) in the expenses history, simulating the action of moving to a different view or category as in the source test case
~~~

This action maintains the functional similarity with the source test case by navigating to a different view of the expenses data, even though the exact UI implementation differs between the source and target apps.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d.click(247, 96)

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have already executed several actions that correspond to the steps in the source test case. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next appropriate action:

1. We've already opened a menu (possibly similar to a navigation drawer) by clicking on "More options".
2. We've selected a comprehensive view of expenses by clicking on "* ALL *".
3. We've navigated to the expenses history view.
4. We've moved through different months in the expenses history.

The next logical step would be to simulate the action of clicking on the third tab in the tab layout from the source test case. However, in the current app, there doesn't seem to be a direct equivalent to tabs. Instead, we can try to navigate to a different view or category of expenses.

Given the current page's intentions, let's try to click on the "Total" label, which might give us a different view of the expenses:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (21, 190), click, "Total"):Click on the "Total" label to potentially view a different category or summary of expenses, simulating the action of clicking on a different tab in the source app
~~~
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(21, 190)
···

This code uses the coordinates (21, 190) to perform a click action, which simulates clicking on the "Total" label. The use of coordinates is preferred as per the requirements, and it's the most precise way to interact with the specific location on the screen.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), click, NULL): Click to navigate up from the Expenses history page to the main Expenses page, which displays the total month expenses, a button with the total amount, and a floating action button for adding new expenses.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), longClick, NULL): Long press on the Navigate up button to return to the main Expenses page, which contains a total month expenses display, a button showing the total amount, and a floating action button for adding new expenses.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (72, 38), click, "Expenses history"): Click on the "Expenses history" text to view the expenses history. The page remains the same after clicking, with no new elements added.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (72, 38), long_click, "Expenses history"): Long click on the "Expenses history" text. This action does not navigate to a new page or cause any visible changes in the UI elements.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/prev_button, (16, 96), click, NULL): Click to view the previous month's expenses. The month displayed changes from "October" to "September" in the TextView with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/month_expense".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/prev_button, (16, 96), long_click, NULL): Long click on the previous button to navigate to the previous month (September) in the expenses history. The month displayed changes from "October" to "September" in the TextView with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/month_expense".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/month_expense, (74, 96), click, "October"): Click on the month display to potentially show a month selection dialog or change the displayed month, but no visible changes occur on the current page.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/month_expense, (74, 96), long_click, "October"): Long click on the month name to potentially open a month selection dialog or menu. No new page or elements appear after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/next_button, (247, 96), click, NULL): Click to navigate to the next month (November) in the expenses history. The month display changes from "October" to "November" with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/month_expense".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/next_button, (247, 96), long_click, NULL): Long click on the 'Next' button to navigate to the next month (November) in the expenses history view. The month displayed changes from "October" to "November" in the element with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/month_expense".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (21, 190), click, "Total"): Click on the "Total" label. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes in the UI elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (21, 190), long_click, "Total"): Long click on the "Total" text. No new page or dialog appears, and no visible changes occur in the UI after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_history, (71, 190), click, "$0.00"): Click on the total expenses amount. No new page or dialog appears after this action, as the JSON data remains unchanged.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_history, (71, 190), long_click, "$0.00"): Long click on the total expense amount. This action does not navigate to a new page or bring up any new dialogs or popups, as the page content remains unchanged after the interaction.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have already navigated through different views and categories in the target app, which corresponds to the actions in the source test case. The next step should be to verify if we have completed all the required actions from the source test case or if there are any remaining steps to be executed. Let's analyze:

1. We've already interacted with a menu (possibly similar to a navigation drawer) by clicking on "More options".
2. We've selected different views/categories by interacting with various elements.
3. We've navigated through different months, which could be seen as switching between tabs or views.

It seems that we have covered the main actions from the source test case. However, to ensure we've completed all steps, let's perform one more action to simulate clicking on the third tab as mentioned in the source test case. We'll use the "Total" label again, as it might represent a different category or summary view.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_history, (71, 190), click, "$0.00"):Click on the total expenses amount to potentially view a different category or summary of expenses, simulating the action of clicking on the third tab in the source app
DONE
~~~

This action should complete the migration of the test case from the source app to the target app. We've simulated opening a navigation menu, selecting different items/categories, and navigating through different views or tabs. The DONE statement indicates that we believe all steps from the source test case have been successfully migrated to the target app.
Based on the provided action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(71, 190)
···

This code clicks on the specified coordinates (71, 190) which corresponds to the total expenses amount. The action is performed using the device variable 'd' as specified in the input.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/title, (136, 37), click, "* ALL *"):Click to open the expense category selection menu to view all expenses, similar to switching to a comprehensive view in the source app, Exec_Success

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month_description, (16, 96), click, "Total of month expenses"):Click on the total month description to view expenses, which may correspond to selecting a specific view or category in the source app, Exec_Success

ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), click, "$0.00"):Click to view the expenses history, which may be equivalent to switching to a different tab or view in the source app, Exec_Success

ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/next_button, (247, 96), click, NULL):Click to navigate to the next month (September) in the expenses history, simulating the action of moving to a different view or category as in the source test case, Exec_Success

ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/next_button, (247, 96), click, NULL):Click to navigate to the next month (October) in the expenses history, simulating the action of moving to a different view or category as in the source test case, Exec_Success

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (21, 190), click, "Total"):Click on the "Total" label to potentially view a different category or summary of expenses, simulating the action of clicking on a different tab in the source app, Exec_Success

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_history, (71, 190), click, "$0.00"):Click on the total expenses amount to potentially view a different category or summary of expenses, simulating the action of clicking on the third tab in the source app, Exec_Success
