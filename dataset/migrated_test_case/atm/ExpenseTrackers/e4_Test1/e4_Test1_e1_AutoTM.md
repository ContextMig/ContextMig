#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with adding an income, so we need to find a corresponding action in the target application. Let's proceed with the first step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/fab_expand_menu_button, (236, 556), click, NULL): Click to expand the menu to reveal options for adding income/expense
~~~

This action corresponds to the first step in the source test case, which is to open the income addition screen. By expanding the menu, we should be able to access the option to add income in the next step.
Based on the provided input, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(236, 556)
···

This code uses the coordinates (236, 556) to click on the ImageButton that expands the menu, revealing options for adding income/expense. Since precise coordinates are provided, this is the optimal choice for the action as per the requirements.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with adding an income, and we have just expanded the menu in the target app to reveal options for adding income/expense. Let's proceed with the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/fab_new_expense, (244, 494), click, NULL): Click to open the "Add expense" page to add a new income entry.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 1 in the source test case: "Click on the 'Add income' button to open the income addition screen." Although the button in the target app is labeled as "Add expense," it's common for expense tracker apps to use the same form for both expenses and incomes, with a toggle to switch between the two. We'll proceed with this action and then verify if there's an option to switch to income on the next page.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d.click(244, 494)
···

This code uses the coordinate-based click method, which is the preferred option as per the requirements. The action will click on the ImageButton at the specified coordinates (244, 494) to open the "Add expense" page for adding a new income entry.

ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/save_expense_fab, (236, 205), long_click, NULL): Long click on the save expense button. This action triggers a validation message "Enter a description" to appear, indicating that the description field is required before saving the expense.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I will proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the appropriate action:

1. We are currently on the "Add expense" page of the target application.
2. The next step in the source test case is to attempt adding an income without filling any fields.
3. However, we notice that the target app has a switch to toggle between expense and income, which wasn't present in the source app.

Given these observations, we should first switch the type to "Income" before attempting to add an entry without filling any fields. Here's the next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Switch, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/expense_type_switch, (30, 285), click, "OFF"):Click the switch to change the expense type from "Expense" to "Income"
~~~

This action will change the page from "Add expense" to "Add income", aligning it more closely with the source test case's intention of adding income.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the action:

···
d.click(30, 285)
···

This code uses the coordinates (30, 285) to click on the Switch widget, which will toggle the expense type from "Expense" to "Income". Using coordinates is the preferred method as specified in the requirements, and it's the most precise way to interact with the UI element in this case.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the appropriate action:

1. We've successfully opened the income addition screen (Step 1 of the source test case).
2. The next step in the source test case is to attempt adding an income without filling any fields.

Given the current page's intentions and the executed action sequence, here's the next step for the test migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/save_expense_fab, (236, 205), click, NULL): Click to save the income entry without filling any fields to test validation
~~~

This action corresponds to Step 2 in the source test case, where we attempt to add an income without filling any fields. In the target app, we're using the save button (represented by an ImageButton) instead of a MenuItem, but the purpose remains the same - to trigger the validation check for empty fields.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(236, 205)
···

This code uses the coordinates (236, 205) to click on the save expense button. The coordinates are preferred as they are precise and provided in the action description. This approach ensures that the exact location is clicked, which is ideal for interacting with the UI element described as an ImageButton with the ID "com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/save_expense_fab".

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll continue the test case migration. Here's the next step:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (146, 130), matches, "Enter a description"):Verify that an error message "Enter a description" is displayed when attempting to save without filling the required fields
~~~

This assertion corresponds to step 3 in the source test case, where we verify that an error message is displayed when trying to add an income without filling the required fields. In the target app, the error message is "Enter a description" instead of "Field can't be empty", but it serves the same purpose of validating required fields.

The next step would be to enter the price/amount for the income entry. However, in the target app, we need to enter the description first. So, let's proceed with entering the description:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/description_edittext, (30, 101), input, "GRA"):Enter "GRA" as the description for the income entry
~~~

This action corresponds to step 7 in the source test case, where we enter the title "GRA". In the target app, this field is called "description" instead of "title", but it serves the same purpose.
Based on the given actions, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
assert d(text="Enter a description").exists()

d(resourceId="com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/description_edittext").set_text("GRA")
···

This code first asserts that the error message "Enter a description" is displayed, and then enters "GRA" into the description field using the resource ID provided.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at step 7 of the source test case. We have already entered the description "GRA" into the description field. The next step in the source test case is to enter the category, but in the target app, there is no separate category field visible. Instead, we should proceed to enter the amount. Here's the next action to take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/amount_edittext, (30, 170), input, "1500"):Enter the value "1500" into the amount input field for the income entry
~~~

This action corresponds to step 4 in the source test case, where we enter the price. In the target app, we're entering it as the amount. After this, we should attempt to save the income entry to see if it's successful or if there are any other required fields.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d(resourceId="com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/amount_edittext").set_text("1500")
```

This code uses the resourceId of the EditText widget to set the text "1500" into the amount input field for the income entry. This approach is preferred when the widget ID is available and unique, as it's more reliable than using coordinates for text input operations.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I will proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Here's my analysis and recommendation:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/save_expense_fab, (236, 205), click, NULL): Click to save the income entry with all fields filled.
~~~

Explanation:
1. We have successfully migrated steps 1-8 of the source test case to the target application.
2. The next logical step in the source test case (step 9) is to click on the "Add" action menu item to add the income entry with all fields filled.
3. In the target application, we don't have an "Add" action menu item. Instead, we have a save button represented by an ImageButton with the id "save_expense_fab".
4. This save button serves the same purpose as the "Add" action menu item in the source application, which is to save the income entry.
5. We have already filled in the description ("GRA") and the amount ("1500"), which corresponds to the information entered in the source test case.
6. Therefore, clicking this save button is the appropriate action to take at this point in the test case migration.

This action should complete the addition of the income entry, and if successful, we can proceed to verify that the entry has been added correctly in the next step.
Based on the given action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(236, 205)
···

This code uses the coordinates provided (236, 205) to perform a click action, which aligns with the requirement to prefer using coordinates when they are precise. This will click the save button to save the income entry with all fields filled.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case semantics, it appears that we have successfully migrated steps 1 through 9 of the source test case. The next step to migrate is step 10, which involves verifying that the added income entry is displayed with the correct title. Let's proceed with this step:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/expense_title, (70, 398), matches, "GRA"):Verify that the added income entry is displayed with the title "GRA" in the list.
DONE
~~~

This assertion checks if the income entry we just added is visible in the list with the correct title "GRA". If this assertion passes, it means we have successfully completed the migration of all steps from the source test case to the target application.

The DONE statement indicates that we have completed the migration of all steps from the source test case to the target application. All the essential functionalities, including adding an income entry, validating required fields, and verifying the added entry, have been covered in the migrated test case.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the provided action:

···
assert d(resourceId="com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/expense_title", text="GRA").exists()
···

This code uses the resourceId and text attributes to verify that the TextView with the title "GRA" exists in the list. This approach is more reliable than using coordinates, as it directly checks for the specific content we're interested in.
