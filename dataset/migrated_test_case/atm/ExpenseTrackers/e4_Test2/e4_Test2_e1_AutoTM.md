#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with clicking on an item in a list view to open the expense entry screen. However, in the target application, we need to use the floating action button to add a new expense. Let's proceed with the first step of the migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/fab_expand_menu_button, (236, 556), click, NULL):Click to expand the menu, revealing options to add recurring expense/income and add expense/income
~~~

This action will expand the floating action button menu, which should reveal the option to add a new expense. This corresponds to the first step in the source test case where we're trying to open the expense entry screen.
Based on the given action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the requested operation:

···
d.click(236, 556)
···

This code uses the coordinates (236, 556) to click on the ImageButton, which will expand the menu and reveal options for adding recurring expense/income and adding expense/income. Using coordinates is the optimal choice as per the requirements, and it's the most precise way to interact with the specific element.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case, we can proceed with the next step of the test migration. The source test case starts with selecting an item from a list view to open the expense entry screen. In the target app, we've expanded the menu to reveal options for adding expenses. Let's proceed with adding a new expense.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/fab_new_expense, (244, 494), click, NULL):Click to open the "Add expense" page
~~~

This action corresponds to step 1 of the source test case, where we're navigating to the expense entry screen. In the target app, we're using the "Add expense" button that was revealed after expanding the menu.
Based on the provided action, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

```
d.click(244, 494)
```

This code uses the coordinates (244, 494) to click on the "Add expense" button, which is the optimal choice as per the requirements. The action is performed using the device variable 'd' as specified in the device variable name.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears we are now on the "Add expense" page. Let's proceed with the next step of the test case migration.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/amount_edittext, (30, 170), click, NULL):Click on the amount input field to enter the expense amount
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/amount_edittext, (30, 170), input, "1700"):Enter the price "1700" into the amount input field
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've reached step 2 of the source test case, which involves entering the price "1700".
2. In the target app, we first need to click on the amount input field to focus it.
3. Then, we input the value "1700" into the amount field.

This action corresponds to step 2 in the source test case: "ACTION (EditText, R.id.et_price, (), input, "1700"): Enter the price "1700" into the price input field."
Based on the provided actions, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

```
d.click(30, 170)
d(resourceId="com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/amount_edittext").set_text("1700")
```

This code first clicks on the amount input field using the provided coordinates, then uses the resource ID to set the text to "1700" in the input field.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've successfully opened the "Add expense" page.
2. We've entered the amount "1700" into the amount input field.

The next step in the source test case is to enter the title "GTA" into the title input field. In the target app, we have a description field instead of a title field. Let's use this field for the same purpose.

Here's the next action to take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/description_edittext, (30, 101), click, NULL):Click to focus on the description input field
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/description_edittext, (30, 101), input, "GTA"):Enter the description "GTA" into the description input field
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in the source test case. We're clicking on the description field to focus it, then inputting "GTA" as the description, which serves the same purpose as the title in the source app.
Based on the provided actions, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d(resourceId="com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/description_edittext").click()
d(resourceId="com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/description_edittext").set_text("GTA")
···

This code first clicks on the description input field to focus it, and then sets the text "GTA" into the field. I've used the resourceId for both actions as it's preferred for text input operations when the widget ID is known.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've successfully added the expense amount "1700" and description "GTA".
2. The next logical step in the source test case is to save the expense.

Given the current page's intent description, we can see that there's a save button available:

ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/save_expense_fab, (236, 205), click, NULL): Click to save the expense.

This action corresponds to step 4 in the source test case: "Click on the "Add" action menu item to save the expense."

Therefore, the next action should be:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/save_expense_fab, (236, 205), click, NULL):Click to save the expense and return to the main budget page
~~~

This action should save the expense and navigate to the main budget page where we can verify the newly added expense.
Based on the given action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(236, 205)
···

This code uses the coordinates provided (236, 205) to perform a click action, which should save the expense and return to the main budget page. Using coordinates is the preferred method as specified in the requirements, and it's the most direct way to interact with the UI element in this case.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case, it appears that we have successfully migrated steps 1 through 4 of the source test case. The next steps involve verifying that the expense has been added correctly. Let's proceed with the assertion steps:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/expense_title, (70, 398), matches, "GTA"):Verify that the title "GTA" is displayed in the expense list
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/expense_amount, (70, 419), matches, "$1,700.00"):Verify that the amount "$1,700.00" is displayed in the expense list
DONE
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've added two assertions to verify that the expense has been correctly added to the list.
2. The first assertion checks for the presence of the "GTA" title in the expense list.
3. The second assertion verifies that the amount "$1,700.00" is displayed correctly.
4. These assertions correspond to steps 5 and 6 in the source test case.
5. Since we've now covered all steps from the source test case, we can conclude with "DONE" to indicate that the migration is complete.

Note: The coordinates and IDs used in the assertions are based on the information provided in the current page's intent description. The exact format of the displayed amount ($1,700.00 instead of + 1700) is adjusted to match the target app's display format as seen in the intent description.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the given actions:

···
assert d(resourceId="com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/expense_title", text="GTA").exists()
assert d(resourceId="com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/expense_amount", text="$1,700.00").exists()
···

This code performs the following actions:
1. Asserts that an element with the resource ID "expense_title" and text "GTA" exists, verifying the title of the expense.
2. Asserts that an element with the resource ID "expense_amount" and text "$1,700.00" exists, verifying the amount of the expense.

These assertions check for the presence of the specified text in the correct UI elements, ensuring that the expense details are displayed correctly in the list.
