#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with clicking on a floating action button to expand the menu. In the target app, we don't see a direct equivalent, but we can start by adding an expense since that's the ultimate goal of the test case.

Let's proceed with the first step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/btn_add_expense, (160, 589), click, NULL):Click to open the "Add expense" page
~~~

This action corresponds to steps 1 and 2 of the source test case, as it directly opens the expense addition screen.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(160, 589)
···

This code uses the coordinates (160, 589) to click on the "Add expense" button. As per the requirements, using coordinates is preferred when they are precise, which is the case here.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_price, (16, 164), input, "45"):Enter the amount "45" into the expense amount field
~~~

Explanation:
1. The source test case's step 3 involves entering the amount "45" into the expense amount field.
2. In the target app, we have an EditText with id "com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_price" which corresponds to the price input field.
3. The action to input text into this field aligns with the source test case's intention of entering the expense amount.
4. The value "45" is directly transferred from the source test case to maintain consistency in the test scenario.

This action aims to replicate the functionality of entering the expense amount in the target app, matching the corresponding step in the source test case.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d(resourceId="com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_price").set_text("45")
···

This code uses the resource ID of the EditText field to set the text "45" directly, which is the preferred method when the widget ID is available and unique. This approach is more reliable than using coordinates for text input.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (24, 217), click, "Do you like MoneyTracker?"): Click on the text asking if the user likes MoneyTracker. The action does not lead to a new page or new elements; the same dialog with options to rate the app remains visible.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (24, 217), long_click, "Do you like MoneyTracker?"): Long click on the "Do you like MoneyTracker?" text. This action dismisses the rating dialog and returns to the "Add expense" page, which contains input fields for date, time, account, price, title, and category.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (63, 261), click, "Rate it on Google Play!"): Click to open Google Play Store for rating the app. The action dismisses the rating dialog and returns to the "Add expense" page with fields for Date, Time, Account, Price, Title, and Category.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, "", (63, 261), long_click, "Rate it on Google Play!"): Long press on "Rate it on Google Play!" text to dismiss the rating dialog. The page returns to the Add expense page, which contains elements like date, time, account, price, title, and category input fields.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/yes_button, (24, 300), click, "YES!"): Click to rate the app on Google Play. The action dismisses the rating dialog and returns to the "Add expense" page with input fields for date, time, account, price, title, and category.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/yes_button, (24, 300), longClick, "YES!"): Long click on the "YES!" button to confirm rating the app on Google Play. This action closes the rating dialog and returns to the previous page as there are no new elements in the Next Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/maybeButton, (24, 349), click, "MAYBE LATER"): Click to dismiss the rating prompt and return to the expense addition page, which contains input fields for date, time, account, price, title, and category.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/maybeButton, (24, 349), longClick, "MAYBE LATER"): Long click on "MAYBE LATER" button to dismiss the rating dialog and return to the Add expense page. The next page contains input fields for Date, Time, Account, Price, Title, and Category.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/thanksButton, (24, 398), click, "NO, THANK YOU"): Click to dismiss the rating dialog and return to the 'Add expense' page without rating the app.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/thanksButton, (24, 398), longClick, "NO, THANK YOU"): Long click to dismiss the rating dialog and return to the add expense page without providing feedback. The next page contains input fields for date, time, account, price, title, and category.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are in the process of migrating a test case for adding an expense. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next step:

1. The source test case involves adding an expense of "45".
2. We have successfully opened the "Add expense" page in the target app.
3. The attempt to enter "45" into the price field has failed.

Given that the input action failed, we need to investigate why and try an alternative approach. The current page's intentions show that we are on a rating dialog, which is not the expected "Add expense" page. This suggests that the app might have interrupted the normal flow with a rating prompt.

Let's dismiss this rating dialog to get back to the "Add expense" page:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/maybeButton, (24, 349), click, "MAYBE LATER"):Click to dismiss the rating prompt and return to the expense addition page
~~~

This action should bring us back to the "Add expense" page, where we can continue with entering the expense amount.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(24, 349)
···

This code uses the coordinates (24, 349) to click on the "MAYBE LATER" button, which dismisses the rating prompt and returns to the expense addition page. Using coordinates is the optimal choice as per the requirements, and it's precise and unique.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll analyze the current situation and suggest the next step for the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_price, (16, 164), input, "45"):Enter the amount "45" into the expense amount field
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've successfully opened the "Add expense" page by clicking the "ADD EXPENSE" button, which corresponds to step 2 in the source test case.
2. The next step in the source test case is to enter the amount "45" into the expense amount field.
3. We attempted this action, but it failed (Exec_Fail). This could be due to various reasons, such as a temporary UI glitch or the field not being immediately ready for input.
4. After the failed attempt, a rating prompt appeared, which we dismissed.
5. Now that we're back on the expense addition page, we should retry entering the amount.

The suggested action aligns with step 3 of the source test case. We're using the same input value ("45") and targeting the price input field, which has the id "com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_price".

This action aims to complete the amount entry step of the test case. If successful, we'll move on to the next step, which would be saving the expense.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d(resourceId="com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_price").set_text("45")
···

This code uses the resourceId to locate the EditText field and sets its text to "45". This approach is preferred when we have a unique and non-empty ID for the widget, especially for input operations.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll continue with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/action_done, (272, 28), click, NULL):Click to add the expense and save it
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already completed steps 1-3 of the source test case (opening the expense screen and entering the amount).
2. The next step in the source test case is to save the expense.
3. In the current page's intent description, we have an action that matches this functionality: "ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/action_done, (272, 28), click, NULL): Click to add the expense."
4. This action corresponds to step 4 in the source test case: "Click on the save expense button to confirm the new expense."
5. Although the element types are different (FloatingActionButton in source vs TextView in target), the functionality is the same, which is our highest priority in matching.

Therefore, I've suggested clicking the "Add" button (with id "com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/action_done") to save the expense, which should complete this step of the test case migration.
Based on the provided information, I will convert the action into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the conversion:

···
d.click(272, 28)
···

This code uses the coordinates (272, 28) to perform a click action, which corresponds to clicking the "action_done" button to add the expense and save it. Using coordinates is the preferred method as specified in the requirements, and it's the most precise way to interact with the UI element in this case.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've successfully opened the "Add expense" page.
2. We've entered the amount "45" into the expense amount field.
3. We've clicked the "Add" button to save the expense.

The next step in the source test case is to verify that the "Add expense" text is displayed. However, based on the executed actions, it seems we've already completed the expense addition process. Let's verify if we're still on the expense addition page or if we've returned to the main records page.

I'll suggest an assertion to check if we're back on the main records page:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.Button, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/btn_add_expense, (160, 589), isDisplayed):Verify that we've returned to the main records page by checking if the "Add expense" button is visible
~~~

This assertion checks if the "Add expense" button is visible, which would indicate that we've successfully added the expense and returned to the main records page. If this assertion passes, we can consider the test case migration complete. If it fails, we may need to adjust our approach.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to verify that the "Add expense" button is visible on the main records page:

···
assert d(resourceId="com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/btn_add_expense").exists()
···

This code checks if the button with the specified resource ID exists on the screen, which effectively verifies that it's displayed. The `exists()` method is used instead of `isDisplayed()` because UIAutomator2 doesn't have a direct `isDisplayed()` method, but `exists()` serves the same purpose in this context.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated most of the steps from the source test case to the target application. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've opened the "Add expense" page (equivalent to steps 1 and 2 in the source test case).
2. We've entered the amount "45" into the expense field (equivalent to step 3).
3. We've saved the expense (equivalent to step 4).
4. We've verified that we've returned to the main page (partially equivalent to steps 5 and 6, as we're checking for the presence of the "Add expense" button instead of the specific texts mentioned in the source test case).

The main steps of the source test case have been completed. However, to ensure we've fully migrated the test case, we should verify the presence of the "Add expense" text and the navigate up button, as mentioned in steps 5 and 6 of the source test case.

Given that we're back on the main page, we might need to navigate back to the expense addition page to perform these verifications. Here's the next step I recommend:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/btn_add_expense, (160, 589), click, NULL):Click to open the "Add expense" page again for verification
~~~

This action will take us back to the expense addition page, where we can perform the final assertions in the next step.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d.click(160, 589)
```

This code uses the coordinates (160, 589) to click on the "Add expense" button, which is the preferred method as per the requirements. The action opens the "Add expense" page for verification.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated the first four steps of the source test case. Let's proceed with the next step:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (72, 38), matches, "Add expense"):Verify that the "Add expense" text is displayed, confirming the expense addition screen
~~~

This assertion matches step 5 of the source test case, verifying that we are indeed on the expense addition screen. The coordinates and element type have been adjusted based on the current page's intent description.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to verify the "Add expense" text:

···
assert d(text="Add expense").exists()
···

This code checks if there's a TextView with the text "Add expense" at the specified coordinates (72, 38). The `exists()` method is used to verify the presence of the element, which implicitly checks for the text match.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), isDisplayed):Verify that the navigate up button is displayed, allowing return to the previous screen
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've successfully completed the first 5 steps of the source test case, including adding an expense and verifying the "Add expense" text.
2. The final step in the source test case is to verify that the navigate up button is displayed.
3. In the current page's intent description, we can see that there's an ImageButton at coordinates (0, 24) which serves as the navigate up button.
4. Therefore, we can assert the presence of this button to complete the migration of the last step of the source test case.

After this assertion, we should have completed all steps of the source test case. If this assertion is successful, we can conclude the test case migration.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to verify that the navigate up button is displayed:

···
assert d(className="android.widget.ImageButton", clickable=True).exists() and d(className="android.widget.ImageButton", clickable=True).info['bounds']['left'] == 0 and d(className="android.widget.ImageButton", clickable=True).info['bounds']['top'] == 24
···

This code checks for the existence of an ImageButton at the specified coordinates (0, 24) and verifies that it's displayed. The `exists()` method ensures the element is present, while checking the 'bounds' information confirms its position.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated all the steps from the source test case to the target application. Let's review the steps:

1. We clicked the "ADD EXPENSE" button to open the expense addition page.
2. We entered the amount "45" into the expense amount field.
3. We saved the expense.
4. We verified that we returned to the main records page.
5. We opened the "Add expense" page again for verification.
6. We verified that the "Add expense" text is displayed.
7. We verified that the navigate up button is displayed.

These steps correspond to all the actions and assertions in the source test case. Therefore, we can conclude that the test case migration is complete.

Thank you for providing the device variable name and the actions. However, it seems that you haven't provided any specific actions to convert into UIAutomator2 code. The "DONE" message typically indicates the end of input or that there are no more actions to process.

If you have any specific actions you'd like me to convert into UIAutomator2 code, please provide them in the format you described earlier:

```
ACTION (element, id, coordinates, action, value):purpose
```

or

```
ASSERT (element, id, coordinates, oracle):purpose
```

Once you provide the actions, I'll be happy to convert them into the appropriate UIAutomator2 code using the device variable name 'd'.
