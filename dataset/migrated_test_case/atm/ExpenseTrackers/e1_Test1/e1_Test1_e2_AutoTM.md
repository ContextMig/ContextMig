### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), click, "Expenses"): Click on the "Expenses" text to navigate to the expenses page. The page remains unchanged after this action, suggesting it may be the title of the current page and not an interactive element.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), long_click, "Expenses"): Long click on the "Expenses" text to perform an action. The long click does not navigate to a new page or create new visible elements.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (260, 24), click, NULL): Click on More options to open a menu. The menu appears with an item "* ALL *" with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/title".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (260, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click to open more options menu. The action does not navigate to a new page or create new visible elements, suggesting the menu might be a popup or overlay not captured in the JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month_description, (16, 96), click, "Total of month expenses"): Click on the total month description. This action does not navigate to a new page or show new widgets, as the Current Page JSON and Next Page JSON are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month_description, (16, 96), long_click, "Total of month expenses"): Long click on the total month description. This action does not lead to any visible changes in the UI or navigation to a new page.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), click, "$0.00"): Click to view the expenses history. The next page shows a monthly expense history view with navigation buttons (prev_button, next_button) and a total expense display (total_history).
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), long_click, "$0.00"): Long click on the total month expenses button to view the expenses history. This action navigates to a new page with a title "Expenses history", showing the current month's expenses and navigation buttons for previous and next months.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab, (248, 568), click, NULL): Click to open the expense creation page. The new page contains input fields for expense value (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value), description (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description), date picker (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/date_picker), expense type spinner (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_type), and a save button (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense).

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with opening the expense menu, and the target app's current page shows an "Expenses" screen with a floating action button to add a new expense. Let's proceed with the first step of the migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab, (248, 568), click, NULL): Click to open the expense creation page
~~~

This action corresponds to steps 1 and 2 of the source test case, where the expand menu button is clicked and then the new expense button is clicked. In the target app, these two steps are combined into a single action of clicking the floating action button to open the expense creation page directly.
Based on the provided information, I will convert the action into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the conversion:

···
d.click(248, 568)
···

This code uses the coordinates (248, 568) to perform a click action, which should open the expense creation page as described in the action. Using coordinates is the preferred method as specified in the requirements, and it's the most precise way to interact with the UI element in this case.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), click, NULL): Click to navigate back to the main Expenses page, which displays the total month expenses ($0.00) and includes a "More options" button in the top right corner.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), long_click, NULL): Long press on the "Navigate up" button to return to the main expenses page, which displays the total month expenses and a button to add new expenses.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), click, "Expenses"): Click on the "Expenses" text to navigate to the expenses input page. The page after clicking contains input fields for expense value (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value), description (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description), date picker (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/date_picker), expense type spinner (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_type), and a save button (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (72, 38), long_click, "Expenses"): Long click on the "Expenses" title. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the current and next page JSONs are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (16, 96), click, NULL): Click on the Money icon to focus on the expense value input field. The page remains the same, but the focus is now on the EditText with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (16, 96), long_click, NULL): Long click on the Money icon to potentially access additional options or information related to expense input. The action does not navigate to a new page or trigger new visible elements.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value, (61, 96), click, "0.00"): Click to edit the expense value. This action does not navigate to a new page, but activates the input field for entering the expense amount.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value, (61, 96), long_click, "0.00"): Long click on the expense value field to select all text or bring up text editing options. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new elements.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense, (16, 335), click, "SAVE"): Click to save the expense. Clicking this button does not navigate to a new page, but may update the current expense entry form.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description, (65, 158), click, "Add a description"): Click to enter a description for the expense. The page remains the same with a focused text input field for entering the expense description.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description, (65, 158), long_click, "Add a description"): Long click on the expense description field to open additional options or context menu for text editing.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/date_picker, (57, 229), click, "08-27-2024"): Click to open date picker dialog to select a date for the expense. The dialog is not visible in the current JSON, suggesting it may be a system dialog or a custom view not captured in the provided layout.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/date_picker, (57, 229), long_click, "08-27-2024"): Long click on the date picker to potentially open a date selection dialog or provide additional options for date input. The action does not navigate to a new page or create new visible elements.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/date_picker, (57, 229), longClick, "08-27-2024"): Long click to open the date picker dialog. The dialog displays a calendar view for date selection with options to choose year, month, and day. It includes "CANCEL" and "OK" buttons with ids "android:id/button2" and "android:id/button1" respectively.
ACTION (android.widget.Spinner, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_type, (16, 283), click, "Food"): Click to open the expense type dropdown list. The new page shows a ListView with various expense categories such as Food, Education, Recreation, Dwelling, Payments, Clothes, Transportation, and Others.
ACTION (android.widget.Spinner, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_type, (16, 283), long_click, "Food"): Long click on the expense type spinner to potentially open a context menu or perform a specific action related to the expense type selection. However, no new page or dialog appears after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (31, 298), click, "Food"): Click to open expense type dropdown list. The next page shows a ListView with different expense categories such as Food, Education, Recreation, etc., each with id "android:id/text1".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (31, 298), long_click, "Food"): Long click on the expense type dropdown to open a menu for selecting different expense categories. After the action, the expense type changes from "Food" to "Payments".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense, (16, 335), longClick, "SAVE"): Long press the SAVE button to attempt saving the expense. A toast message "Ops, type a value!" appears, indicating that a value needs to be entered before saving.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I will proceed with the next step in the test case migration. The source test case is currently at step 3, which involves entering the expense amount. Let's match this step to the target application:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value, (61, 96), click, "0.00"): Click to focus on the expense value input field
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value, (61, 96), input, "45"): Enter the amount "45" into the expense amount field
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in the source test case, where we input the expense amount. I've broken it down into two actions: first clicking to focus on the input field, then entering the value. This approach ensures that the input field is properly activated before entering the value.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given actions:

···
d.click(61, 96)
d(resourceId="luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value").set_text("45")
···

This code first clicks on the expense value input field using the provided coordinates, and then uses the resource ID to set the text to "45" in the input field.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), click, NULL): Click to navigate up and return to the main expenses list. The next page shows the total monthly expenses with a TextView "Total of month expenses" (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month_description) and a Button displaying "$0.00" (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month).
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), long_click, NULL): Long press on the "Navigate up" button to return to the main Expenses page, which displays total monthly expenses with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month" and a "More options" button.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (72, 38), click, "Expenses"): Click on the "Expenses" title. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the current page and next page JSONs are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, "", (72, 38), long_click, "Expenses"): Long click on the "Expenses" title. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes in the UI elements.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (16, 96), click, NULL): Click on the Money icon. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, but it might focus on the expense value input field with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (16, 96), long_click, NULL): Long click on the Money icon to potentially bring up additional options or information related to the expense value entry. No new page or dialog appears, but it might trigger a context menu or tooltip with more details about the money input field.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value, (61, 96), click, "45"): Click to edit the expense value. The page remains the same, allowing the user to modify the expense amount.

ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense, (16, 335), click, "SAVE"): Click to save the expense. This action does not navigate to a new page, but may trigger the saving of the entered expense data.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description, (65, 158), click, "Add a description"): Click to edit the description of the expense. The page remains the same, but the keyboard should appear for text input.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description, (65, 158), long_click, "Add a description"): Long click on the expense description field to open the text selection menu. The action does not navigate to a new page, but may trigger a context menu for text editing options.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/date_picker, (57, 229), click, "08-27-2024"): Click to open the date picker dialog to select a date for the expense. The action does not navigate to a new page, but likely opens a date picker dialog overlay.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (16, 229), longClick, NULL): Long press on the Date icon to potentially access additional date-related options or information. No new page or dialog appears, suggesting this action might not have a specific effect in the current implementation.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/date_picker, (57, 229), longClick, "08-27-2024"): Long click to open the date picker dialog. The dialog contains a calendar view with id "android:id/day_picker_view_pager", a year selector with id "android:id/date_picker_header_year", and buttons for "CANCEL" (id: "android:id/button2") and "OK" (id: "android:id/button1") to confirm or cancel the date selection.
ACTION (android.widget.Spinner, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_type, (16, 283), click, "Food"): Click to open a dropdown list of expense types. The new list contains options like "Food", "Education", "Recreation", "Dwelling", "Payments", "Clothes", "Transportation", and "Others", each with id "android:id/text1".
ACTION (android.widget.Spinner, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_type, (16, 283), long_click, "Food"): Long click on the expense type spinner to potentially access additional options or actions related to expense categories. The action does not navigate to a new page or create new visible elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (31, 298), click, "Food"): Click to open a dropdown list of expense types including Food, Education, Recreation, Dwelling, Payments, Clothes, Transportation, and Others.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (31, 298), long_click, "Food"): Long click on the expense type to open a selection menu. After the action, the expense type text changes from "Food" to "Payments" in the spinner with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_type".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense, (16, 335), longClick, "SAVE"): Long click on the "SAVE" button to save the expense. After saving, the app returns to the main expenses page, which displays the total monthly expenses (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month) and has a floating action button (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab) for adding new expenses.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense, (16, 335), click, NULL): Click to save the expense
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (72, 38), matches, "Expenses"): Verify that the "Expenses" text is displayed, confirming the expense addition screen
ASSERT (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), isDisplayed, NULL): Verify that the navigate up button is displayed, allowing return to the previous screen
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already completed steps 1-3 of the source test case (opening the expense creation screen and entering the amount).
2. The next logical step is to save the expense, which corresponds to step 4 in the source test case.
3. After saving, we perform two assertions to verify the UI elements, which align with steps 5 and 6 of the source test case.
4. The "SAVE" button in the target app seems to serve the same purpose as the "save_expense_fab" in the source app.
5. We're verifying the "Expenses" text instead of "Add expense" as that's what's available in the target app, but it still confirms we're on the correct screen.
6. The navigate up button is verified as in the original test case.

This completes the migration of all steps from the source test case to the target app. However, I'll wait for your confirmation before marking it as DONE.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(16, 335)
assert d(text="Expenses").exists()
assert d(className="android.widget.ImageButton", description="Navigate up").exists()
···

Explanation:
1. For the first action, we use the coordinates (16, 335) to click the save expense button.
2. For the first assertion, we check if the text "Expenses" exists on the screen.
3. For the second assertion, we verify if the navigate up button (typically an ImageButton with the description "Navigate up") is displayed.

Note: The code uses the device variable name 'd' as specified in the input. The assertions use the existence check to verify if the elements are displayed on the screen.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), click, "Expenses"): Click on the "Expenses" text to potentially navigate to a detailed expenses view or refresh the current page. No new page or widgets appear after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), longClick, "Expenses"): Long click on the "Expenses" text to potentially trigger a context menu or additional options. The total month expenses value changed from $135.00 to $180.00, suggesting a refresh or update of expense data.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (260, 24), click, NULL): Click on the More options button to open a menu with options including "* ALL *" and "Food" for filtering expenses.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (260, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click on More options button to open additional settings or actions. The action doesn't navigate to a new page, but may display a popup menu with additional options.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month_description, (16, 96), click, "Total of month expenses"): Click to view total month expenses. The total amount displayed in the next page has changed from $135.00 to $315.00, suggesting an update or recalculation of the monthly expenses.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month_description, (16, 96), long_click, "Total of month expenses"): Long click on the total month description. This action does not navigate to a new page, but updates the total month expenses value from $135.00 to $360.00 in the element with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), click, "$135.00"): Click to view the expenses history. The next page shows a list of expenses for the month of August, with a total of $405.00, and includes navigation buttons (prev_button, next_button) to switch between months.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), long_click, "$135.00"): Long click on the total month expense button to view the detailed expense history. This action navigates to the Expenses history page, which displays a list of expenses with details such as type, amount, and date, along with a total sum at the bottom.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab, (248, 568), click, NULL): Click to open the expense creation page. The new page contains input fields for expense value (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value), description (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description), date picker (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/date_picker), expense type spinner (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_type), and a save button (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense).
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab, (248, 568), long_click, NULL): Long click on the floating action button to open the expense creation page. The new page contains input fields for expense value (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value), description (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description), date picker (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/date_picker), expense type spinner (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_type), and a save button (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense).

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated all the steps from the source test case to the target application. Let's review the steps:

1. We clicked on the floating action button to open the expense creation page.
2. We entered the amount "45" into the expense value field.
3. We clicked the save button to confirm the new expense.
4. We verified that the "Expenses" text is displayed, confirming we're back on the main expense screen.
5. We verified that the navigate up button is displayed.

These actions correspond to all the steps in the source test case, with some adaptations to the target app's UI. The only step we didn't explicitly perform was clicking on an expand menu button, but this seems to be because the target app's UI is different and doesn't require this step.

Given that we've completed all the necessary steps and verifications, we can conclude that the test case migration is complete. Therefore, I'll respond with DONE:

~~~
DONE
~~~
I understand that you want me to convert Android test semantic actions into UIAutomator2 code in Python. However, you haven't provided any specific actions to convert in your last message. You only mentioned "DONE" under the Actions section.

Without any actual actions to convert, I cannot generate any UIAutomator2 code. If you have specific actions you'd like me to convert, please provide them in the format you described earlier:

ACTION (element, id, coordinates, action, value):purpose

or

ASSERT (element, id, coordinates, oracle):purpose

Once you provide these actions, I'll be happy to convert them into UIAutomator2 code for you, using the device variable name 'd' as you specified.
