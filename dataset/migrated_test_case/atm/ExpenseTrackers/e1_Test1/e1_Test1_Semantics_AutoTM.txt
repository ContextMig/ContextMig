Based on the provided Android test case, I'll generate a corresponding function description following the specified format:

This test case is testing the expense addition functionality in the EasyBudget app.

The detailed process with serial numbers is as follows:

1. ACTION (FloatingActionButton, R.id.fab_expand_menu_button, (), click, NULL): Click on the expand menu button to reveal expense options.

2. ACTION (FloatingActionButton, R.id.fab_new_expense, (), click, NULL): Click on the new expense button to open the expense creation screen.

3. ACTION (EditText, R.id.amount_edittext, (), input, "45"): Enter the amount "45" into the expense amount field.

4. ACTION (FloatingActionButton, R.id.save_expense_fab, (), click, NULL): Click on the save expense button to confirm the new expense.

5. ASSERT (TextView, , (), matches, "Add expense"): Verify that the "Add expense" text is displayed, confirming the expense addition screen.

6. ASSERT (ImageButton, , (), isDisplayed, NULL): Verify that the navigate up button is displayed, allowing return to the previous screen.

This function description outlines the steps to add a new expense in the EasyBudget app, including opening the expense menu, entering an amount, saving the expense, and verifying the UI elements after the action is completed.
