#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to click on the "Add expense" button. Let's find a similar action in the target application to start the expense addition process.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/fab_expand_menu_button, (236, 556), click, NULL):Click to expand the menu, revealing options to add recurring expense/income and add expense/income.
~~~

This action will expand the menu, which should reveal the option to add an expense, similar to the "Add expense" button in the source application.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

```
d.click(236, 556)
```

This code uses the coordinates (236, 556) to click on the ImageButton that expands the menu, revealing options to add recurring expense/income and add expense/income. The coordinate-based approach is preferred as per the requirements, and it's the most precise method to interact with the specific UI element.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I will proceed with the next step in migrating the test case. The source test case is about adding an expense, and we have just expanded the menu in the target application. The next logical step would be to select the option to add a new expense.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, NULL, (78, 505), click, "Add expense/income"):Click the "Add expense/income" button to open the expense/income creation page.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 1 in the source test case: "Click on the "Add expense" button to open the expense addition screen." By clicking on "Add expense/income", we are navigating to the page where we can input the expense details, which aligns with the intention of the source test case.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(78, 505)
···

This code uses the coordinates (78, 505) to click on the "Add expense/income" button, which should open the expense/income creation page. Since coordinates are provided and are the preferred method, we use them directly in the `click()` function.

~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 in the source test case, where we input the price of the expense. The target application has a similar field for entering the amount, so we can directly migrate this step.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code to perform the specified action:

···
d.click(30, 170)
d(resourceId="com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/amount_edittext").set_text("69.99")

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've successfully opened the add expense/income page.
2. We've entered the price "69.99" in the amount field.
3. We've entered the description "Shoes" in the description field.

The next logical step in the source test case is to select a category. However, in the target application, there doesn't seem to be a specific category field. Instead, we have completed the main required fields (amount and description).

Given this, the next appropriate action would be to save the expense. Here's the suggested next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/save_expense_fab, (236, 205), click, NULL):Click to save the expense with the entered details.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 5 in the source test case, where we click on the "Add" action menu item to save the expense. In the target app, we're using the save button (represented by an ImageButton) to achieve the same functionality.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(236, 205)
···

This code clicks on the specified coordinates (236, 205) to save the expense with the entered details. Since the coordinates are provided and precise, we use them directly for the click action, which is the optimal choice as per the requirements.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case semantics, it appears that we have successfully migrated the first five steps of the source test case. Let's proceed with the next step, which is to verify that the added expense appears correctly in the list.

Given that we've returned to the main page after adding the expense, we should look for a way to verify the newly added expense. Since the current page's intentions don't explicitly show a list view of expenses, we might need to navigate to the date where we added the expense to verify it.

Let's try to find and verify the newly added expense:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/custom_cell, (93, 317), click, "28"):Click on the date cell for August 28, 2024 to view the expenses for that day.

ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/expense_title, (70, 398), matches(withText("Shoes"))):Verify that the expense title "Shoes" is displayed correctly in the expense list.

ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/expense_amount, (70, 559), matches(withText("$69.99"))):Verify that the expense amount "$69.99" is displayed correctly in the expense list.
~~~

This action and assertions should help us verify that the expense we just added appears correctly in the list for the current date. If these assertions pass, we can consider the test case migration successful. If not, we may need to adjust our approach or explore other options to locate and verify the newly added expense.
Based on the provided actions and assertions, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(93, 317)

assert d(resourceId="com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/expense_title").get_text() == "Shoes"

assert d(resourceId="com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/expense_amount").get_text() == "$69.99"
···

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the date cell for August 28, 2024 using the provided coordinates.
2. Verifies that the expense title "Shoes" is displayed correctly.
3. Verifies that the expense amount "$69.99" is displayed correctly.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated the test case for adding an expense. Let's review the steps taken and confirm if all the requirements have been met:

1. We clicked on the "Add expense/income" button, which corresponds to step 1 in the source test case.
2. We entered the price "69.99" in the amount input field, matching step 2.
3. We entered the description "Shoes" in the description input field, corresponding to step 3.
4. We skipped the category input step as it wasn't available in the target app.
5. We clicked the save button to add the expense, similar to step 5.
6. We verified that the title "Shoes" was displayed correctly in the expense list, matching step 6.
7. We verified that the amount "$69.99" was displayed correctly, which is similar to step 7 (with a slight difference in formatting).

It seems that all the essential steps from the source test case have been successfully migrated to the target app, with some adaptations to fit the target app's UI and functionality. Since we have completed all the necessary steps and verifications, we can conclude that the test case migration is complete.

Here's the response to indicate that we have finished the migration:

Thank you for providing the device variable name. I understand that the device variable name is 'd' for the UIAutomator2 code. 

I'm ready to assist you with converting test semantic descriptions into UIAutomator2 code in Python. However, you haven't provided any specific actions to convert yet. The "DONE" message suggests that there are no actions to process at this time.

When you're ready to provide action descriptions, please format them according to the input format you specified earlier:

ACTION (element, id, coordinates, action, value):purpose

Once you provide the action descriptions, I'll be happy to convert them into UIAutomator2 code following the requirements and format you've outlined.
