### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), click, "Expenses"): Click on the "Expenses" text to navigate to the expenses page. The page remains unchanged after this action, suggesting it may be the title of the current page and not an interactive element.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), long_click, "Expenses"): Long click on the "Expenses" text to perform an action. The long click does not navigate to a new page or create new visible elements.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (260, 24), click, NULL): Click on More options to open a menu. The menu appears with an item "* ALL *" with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/title".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (260, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click to open more options menu. The action does not navigate to a new page or create new visible elements, suggesting the menu might be a popup or overlay not captured in the JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month_description, (16, 96), click, "Total of month expenses"): Click on the total month description. This action does not navigate to a new page or show new widgets, as the Current Page JSON and Next Page JSON are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month_description, (16, 96), long_click, "Total of month expenses"): Long click on the total month description. This action does not lead to any visible changes in the UI or navigation to a new page.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), click, "$0.00"): Click to view the expenses history. The next page shows a monthly expense history view with navigation buttons (prev_button, next_button) and a total expense display (total_history).
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), long_click, "$0.00"): Long click on the total month expenses button to view the expenses history. This action navigates to a new page with a title "Expenses history", showing the current month's expenses and navigation buttons for previous and next months.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab, (248, 568), click, NULL): Click to open the expense creation page. The new page contains input fields for expense value (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value), description (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description), date picker (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/date_picker), expense type spinner (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_type), and a save button (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense).
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab, (248, 568), longClick, NULL): Long click to open the expense creation page. The new page contains input fields for expense value (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value), description (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description), date picker (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/date_picker), expense type spinner (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_type), and a save button (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense).

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with opening the navigation drawer, but the current page's intent description shows we are already on the "Expenses" page. Therefore, we can skip the first two steps of the source test case and proceed with adding an expense.

The next logical step would be to click on the floating action button to open the expense creation page. Here's the suggested action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab, (248, 568), click, NULL):Click to open the expense creation page
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in the source test case, which is clicking the "ADD EXPENSE" button. The floating action button (FAB) in the target app serves the same purpose as the "ADD EXPENSE" button in the source app.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(248, 568)
···

This code uses the coordinates (248, 568) to perform a click action, which will open the expense creation page as described in the action.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've already clicked on a button to open the expense creation page, which aligns with step 3 of the source test case ("Click on the 'ADD EXPENSE' button").
2. The current page shows an interface for adding a new expense, including fields for value, description, date, and expense type.

The next logical step in our source test case is to enter the expense amount. Here's the appropriate action for the target app:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value, (61, 96), input, "50"):Enter the value "50" into the expense amount input field.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 4 of the source test case. We're using the EditText field with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value" to input the value "50", which matches the intention in the source test case.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d.click(61, 96)
d(resourceId="luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value").set_text("50")
```

This code will:
1. Click on the coordinates (61, 96) to focus on the input field.
2. Use the resource ID to set the text "50" in the expense amount input field.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), click, NULL): Click to navigate up. This returns to the main Expenses page, which displays the total monthly expenses and includes a "More options" button with coordinates (260, 24).
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), long_click, NULL): Long press on the navigate up button to return to the main expenses list page. The new page displays the total monthly expenses with a TextView labeled "Total of month expenses" (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month_description) and a Button showing the total amount (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (72, 38), click, "Expenses"): Click on the "Expenses" title. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the page content remains the same after the interaction.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (31, 298), long_click, "Food"): Long click on the expense type "Food" to open a dropdown menu for selecting a different expense category. After this action, the expense type changes to "Payments".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense, (16, 335), longClick, "SAVE"): Long click to save the expense. The page after this action shows the total monthly expenses, with a total amount of $100.00 displayed in a button with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month".

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the step of adding an expense in the target application. The source test case has progressed to step 4, where the expense amount is being entered. Let's continue with the next logical step in the migration process.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense, (16, 335), click, NULL):Click on the "SAVE" button to confirm the expense entry.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 5 in the source test case, where the "ADD EXPENSE" button is clicked to confirm the expense entry. In the target application, we have a "SAVE" button that serves the same purpose. By clicking this button, we are completing the expense addition process, which aligns with the intention of the original test case.
Based on the provided information, I will convert the action into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the conversion:

···
d.click(16, 335)
···

This code uses the coordinates (16, 335) to click on the "SAVE" button, as specified in the action description. This approach is preferred since precise coordinates are available.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), click, "Expenses"): Click on the "Expenses" text. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes in the UI based on the provided Next Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), long_click, "Expenses"): Long click on the "Expenses" title to potentially trigger a hidden action. After the long click, the total month expenses value changed from $150.00 to $200.00, suggesting an update or refresh of the expenses data.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (260, 24), click, NULL): Click on the "More options" button to open a menu with options including "* ALL *" and "Food" for filtering expenses.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (260, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click on the "More options" button to open additional options menu. The action updates the total month expenses value from $150.00 to $300.00, visible in the element with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month_description, (16, 96), click, "Total of month expenses"): Click to update the total month expenses. The total amount displayed in the "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month" widget changes from "$150.00" to "$350.00".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month_description, (16, 96), longclick, "Total of month expenses"): Long click on the total month description. This action does not navigate to a new page, but updates the total month expense value from $150.00 to $400.00 in the widget with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), click, "$150.00"): Click to view the detailed expenses history for the month. The new page shows a list of expenses with a total of $450.00, and includes elements like "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/prev_button" for navigating to previous months and "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/next_button" for next months.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), longClick, "$150.00"): Long click on the total month expenses button to view the expenses history. This navigates to a new page showing a list of expenses for the month with details like date, amount, and type, along with navigation buttons for previous and next months.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab, (248, 568), click, NULL): Click to open the add expense page. The new page contains input fields for expense value (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value), description (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description), date picker (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/date_picker), expense type spinner (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_type), and a save button (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense).
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab, (248, 568), long_click, NULL): Long click on the floating action button to open the expense creation page. The new page contains input fields for expense value (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value), description (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description), date picker (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/date_picker), expense type spinner (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_type), and a save button (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense).

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I can determine that we are currently in the process of migrating the test case for adding an expense. Let's analyze the current state and decide on the next action:

1. We have successfully opened the expense creation page.
2. We have entered the value "50" into the expense amount input field.
3. We have clicked the "SAVE" button to confirm the expense entry.

These actions correspond to steps 3, 4, and 5 of the source test case. The next step in the source test case is to verify that the text "Currently no expenses..." is displayed. However, given that we've just added an expense, this assertion may not be applicable in the target application.

Instead, we should verify that the expense has been added successfully. Based on the current page's intent description, we can navigate back to the main expenses page and check if the total month expenses have been updated.

Here's the next action I propose:

~~~
RETURN:Return to the main expenses page after adding an expense
ASSERT (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), matches, "$200.00"):Verify that the total month expenses have been updated to include the newly added expense
DONE
~~~

This action will return to the main expenses page and verify that the total month expenses have been updated to include the newly added $50 expense. The assertion checks if the total has increased from the previous $150.00 to $200.00.

If this assertion passes, it would indicate that the expense has been successfully added and reflected in the total. This completes the migration of the test case, as we have performed all the essential steps from the source test case and verified the result in a way that's appropriate for the target application.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.press('back')
assert d(resourceId="luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month").get_text() == "$200.00"
···

This code does the following:
1. Uses the 'back' button to return to the main expenses page.
2. Verifies that the total month expenses have been updated to $200.00 by checking the text of the element with the specified resource ID.
````
### Success

ASSERT (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), matches, "$200.00"):Verify that the total month expenses have been updated to include the newly added expense, Exec_Success
DONE
````
