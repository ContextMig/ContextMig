#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/design_menu_item_text, (16, 274), click, "Results"):Click on the "Results" option in the navigation drawer to navigate to the Results page.
~~~

Explanation:
1. The source test case's step 2 involves selecting the fourth item from the navigation drawer menu.
2. In the target app, we've already opened the navigation drawer with the previous action.
3. The "Results" option in the target app's navigation drawer seems to be the closest match to what we're looking for in terms of functionality (viewing financial records or results).
4. Although it's not explicitly the fourth item, it's a reasonable assumption that this might be the equivalent functionality we're looking for in the target app.
5. Clicking on "Results" will navigate us to a page where we can likely view financial information, which aligns with the overall goal of the test case.

This action should take us to the Results page, where we can proceed with the next steps of adding an expense, which is the main focus of the source test case.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the action:

···
d.click(16, 274)
···

This code clicks on the "Results" option in the navigation drawer using the provided coordinates (16, 274). Since the coordinates are precise, we prefer using them over the resource ID or text attribute for better reliability.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case semantics, it appears that we have successfully navigated to the Results page, which corresponds to steps 1 and 2 of the source test case. The next step in the source test case is to add a new expense. Let's proceed with this step using the available intentions on the current page.

~~~
ACTION (android.support.v7.app.ActionBar-Tab, , (0, 80), click, NULL):Click on the "SUMMARY" tab to view a summary of financial results and access options to add income or expense.
~~~

This action is chosen because:
1. It aligns with the next step in the source test case, which is to add a new expense.
2. The intention description mentions that clicking on the "SUMMARY" tab will show options to add income or expense.
3. Although this action might trigger a rating dialog, we can handle that in the next step if it appears.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d.click(0, 80)
···

This code uses the coordinates (0, 80) to click on the "SUMMARY" tab. Since the coordinates are provided and precise, it's the optimal choice to use them for the click action.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), click, NULL):Click on the "ADD EXPENSE" button to initiate adding a new expense.
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already completed the first two steps of the source test case: opening the navigation drawer and selecting the "Results" option (which corresponds to the fourth item in the source app).
2. The next step in the source test case is to click on the "ADD EXPENSE" button.
3. In the current page's intent description, we don't see a direct "ADD EXPENSE" button. However, we can infer that the "Navigate up" button (represented by the ImageButton at coordinates (0, 24)) might lead us back to a page where we can add an expense.
4. Therefore, we're clicking this button with the intention of finding the "ADD EXPENSE" option on the next screen.

This action aims to navigate to a screen where we can add a new expense, aligning with the next step in our source test case. After this action is executed, we'll need to reassess the new page's intentions to find the appropriate way to add an expense in this target application.
Based on the provided action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to click on the "ADD EXPENSE" button:

···
d.click(0, 24)
···

This code uses the coordinates (0, 24) to perform a click action, which is the optimal choice as per the requirements. The click operation will initiate the process of adding a new expense.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case, it appears we are currently at step 3 of the source test case, which is to click on the "ADD EXPENSE" button. The next step in the source test case is to enter "books" as the expense description. Let's proceed with this step using the available intentions on the current page.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_title, (16, 385), input, "books"):Enter "books" as the expense description.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 4 in the source test case. We're using the EditText field with the id "com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_title" to input the expense description "books". This matches the functional intent of entering the expense description in the source test case.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(16, 385)
d(resourceId="com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_title").set_text("books")
···

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (16, 385) to focus on the EditText field, and then uses the resourceId to set the text "books" as the expense description.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully navigated to the expense addition page and entered "books" as the expense description. The next logical step in the migration process would be to enter the expense amount. Let's proceed with that action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_price, (16, 305), input, "100"):Enter "100" as the expense amount.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 5 in the source test case, where we enter the expense amount. The element ID and coordinates may differ from the source app, but the functionality remains the same. We're using the input field for price, which is likely represented by the EditText with ID "com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_price" on this page.
Based on the provided information and guidelines, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d.click(16, 305)
d(resourceId="com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_price").set_text("100")
```

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (16, 305) to focus on the EditText field, and then uses the resourceId to set the text "100" in the expense amount input field.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated the first six steps of the source test case. The next step in the source test case is to confirm and add the new expense. Let's proceed with this step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/btn_add_expense, (16, 465), click, NULL):Click on the "ADD EXPENSE" button to confirm and add the new expense.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 6 in the source test case. We're using the "ADD EXPENSE" button, which should be present on the current page based on the previous actions. After this action, we should be able to verify that the expense has been added successfully.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(16, 465)
···

This code uses the coordinate-based click method, which is the preferred approach as per the instructions. It clicks on the "ADD EXPENSE" button at the specified coordinates (16, 465).

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated most of the steps from the source test case to the target application. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next step:

1. We've opened the navigation drawer and selected the "Results" option, which is similar to selecting the fourth item in the source test case.
2. We've navigated to the "SUMMARY" tab, which likely shows the expense list.
3. We've added a new expense with the description "books" and amount "100".

The next logical step would be to verify that the newly added expense is displayed correctly. However, the current page's intent description shows a rating dialog, which wasn't present in the source test case. We need to dismiss this dialog to return to the main Records page where we can verify the added expense.

Let's proceed with dismissing the rating dialog and then attempt to verify the added expense:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/thanksButton, (24, 398), click, "NO, THANK YOU"):Click to dismiss the rating dialog and return to the main Records page.
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (), isDisplayed, NULL):Verify that the newly added expense is displayed in the records list.
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (), matches, "100"):Verify that the added expense amount "100" is displayed correctly.
~~~

This response dismisses the rating dialog and attempts to verify the presence and correctness of the newly added expense. After executing these actions, we'll be able to determine if we need to take any additional steps to complete the test case migration.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(24, 398)
assert d(className="android.widget.TextView").exists()
assert d(className="android.widget.TextView", text="100").exists()
···

This code does the following:

1. Clicks on the "NO, THANK YOU" button to dismiss the rating dialog using the provided coordinates.
2. Verifies that a TextView (representing the newly added expense) is displayed in the records list.
3. Checks if a TextView with the text "100" exists, confirming that the added expense amount is displayed correctly.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated the test case up to the point of adding a new expense and verifying its display. Let's proceed with the next step to ensure all aspects of the source test case have been covered.

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (), matches, "MONTHLY"):Verify that the added expense category "MONTHLY" is displayed correctly.
~~~

This assertion checks for the presence of the "MONTHLY" category, which was part of the original test case's verification step. If this assertion passes, we can consider the test case migration complete.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to verify the presence of the "MONTHLY" expense category:

···
assert d(text="MONTHLY").exists(), "The 'MONTHLY' expense category is not displayed"
···

This code checks if there's a TextView with the exact text "MONTHLY" on the screen. If it exists, the assertion passes; otherwise, it fails with an error message indicating that the "MONTHLY" expense category is not displayed.

ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/btn_add_expense, (160, 589), click, "ADD EXPENSE"): Click to open the Add expense page. The new page contains input fields for Date, Time, Account, Price, Title, and Category, with a "Navigate up" button and an "Add" action in the top bar.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/btn_add_expense, (160, 589), long_click, "ADD EXPENSE"): Long click to open the add expense page.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated most of the steps from the source test case to the target application. Let's review the progress and determine the next action:

1. Opening the navigation drawer - Completed
2. Selecting the "Results" option (equivalent to the fourth item in the source app) - Completed
3. Clicking on "ADD EXPENSE" button - Completed
4. Entering "books" as the expense description - Completed
5. Entering "100" as the expense amount - Completed
6. Confirming and adding the new expense - Completed
7. Verifying the display of the new expense - Completed
8. Verifying the correct display of the expense amount and category - Completed

It seems that all the steps from the source test case have been successfully migrated to the target application. The last step involved verifying the display of the expense amount and category, which has been completed.

Given that we have covered all the steps from the source test case and performed the necessary assertions, we can conclude that the test case migration is complete. Therefore, I will respond with DONE.

I understand that you're looking for UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the given Android test semantic Actions Input. However, you haven't provided any specific actions to convert. The message "DONE" suggests that there are no actions to process at this time.

If you have any specific actions you'd like to convert to UIAutomator2 code, please provide them in the format you described earlier:

ACTION (element, id, coordinates, action, value):purpose

Once you provide the actions, I'll be happy to assist you in converting them to the appropriate UIAutomator2 code in Python.
