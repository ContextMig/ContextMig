### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), click, "Expenses"): Click on the "Expenses" text. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the Current Page JSON and Next Page JSON are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), long_click, "Expenses"): Long click on the "Expenses" text to potentially open a context menu or perform an action related to the app's expenses. However, the action does not lead to any visible changes in the UI based on the provided Next Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (260, 24), click, NULL): Click on the "More options" button to open a dropdown menu with options including "* ALL *" and "Food" for filtering expenses.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (260, 24), longClick, NULL): Long click to open more options menu. The action doesn't lead to a new page, but it likely triggers a popup menu with additional options for managing expenses.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with opening the navigation drawer, but the current page's intentions don't show a navigation drawer. Instead, we see that we're already on the Expenses page. Let's proceed with the next logical step, which is adding a new expense.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab, (248, 568), click, NULL):Click on the floating action button to open the expense creation page
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in the source test case ("Click on the 'ADD EXPENSE' button to initiate adding a new expense"). Although the UI elements are different (a floating action button instead of a regular button), the functionality is the same - initiating the process of adding a new expense.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(248, 568)
···

This code uses the coordinate-based click method, which is the preferred approach as per the requirements. It will click on the floating action button at the specified coordinates (248, 568) to open the expense creation page.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to open the navigation drawer, but in the target app, we've already clicked on a floating action button to open the expense creation page. This suggests that the target app's workflow is slightly different, but we're still on the right track to add a new expense.

Let's proceed with the next step, which corresponds to step 4 in the source test case (entering the expense description). Here's the next action we should take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description, (65, 158), click, NULL):Click to focus on the description input field for the expense
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description, (65, 158), input, "books"):Enter "books" as the expense description
~~~

This action will focus on the description field and input the value "books", which matches the source test case's step 4.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified actions:

···
d.click(65, 158)
d(resourceId="luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description").set_text("books")
···

This code first clicks on the coordinates (65, 158) to focus on the description input field for the expense. Then, it uses the resource ID to set the text "books" as the expense description.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), click, NULL): Click to navigate up from the expense details page to the main expenses list page, which displays the total month expenses ($1060.00) and has a "More options" button.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click on the "Navigate up" button to return to the main expenses list. The next page shows the total monthly expenses summary with a total of $1060.00 displayed in a button with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, "", (72, 38), click, "Expenses"): Click on the "Expenses" text to potentially navigate to the expenses overview or list page. No visible changes in the next page JSON, suggesting this action might not have any immediate effect on the current view.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (72, 38), longClick, "Expenses"): Long click on the "Expenses" title. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes in the UI elements.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I will proceed with the next step in the test case migration. The source test case is currently at step 5, which involves entering the expense amount. Let's match this step to the target application:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value, (61, 96), click, "0.00"):Click to focus on the expense value input field
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value, (61, 96), input, "100"):Enter "100" as the expense amount
~~~

This action corresponds to step 5 in the source test case, where we input the expense amount. I've broken it down into two actions: first clicking to focus on the input field, and then entering the value. This approach ensures that the input field is properly activated before entering the data.
Based on the provided information, I'll convert the actions into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the code wrapped in triple backticks:

```
d.click(61, 96)
d(resourceId="luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value").set_text("100")
```

This code does the following:
1. Clicks on the coordinates (61, 96) to focus on the expense value input field.
2. Uses the resource ID to set the text of the input field to "100".
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets

Based on the provided information, I will proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Here's my response:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense, (16, 335), click, NULL):Click on the "SAVE" button to confirm and add the new expense
ASSERT (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (0, 0), matches, "$1260.00"):Verify that the total monthly expenses have been updated to include the new expense
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already completed steps 1-5 of the source test case. The next step is to save the expense.
2. In the target app, we have a "SAVE" button that corresponds to the "ADD EXPENSE" button in the source app.
3. After saving, we should verify that the expense has been added successfully. In the source app, this was done by checking for a new table row. In the target app, we can verify this by checking if the total monthly expenses have been updated.
4. The assert checks if the total month expenses button shows "$1260.00", which is $200 more than the previous total of $1060.00, accounting for the newly added $100 expense.

This action and assertion complete the core functionality of adding a new expense and verifying its effect on the total expenses. If this is successful, we can consider the test case migration to be complete for the main functionality. However, we should wait for the result of this action before proceeding further or concluding the migration.
Based on the given actions, I'll convert them into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the corresponding code:

···
# Click on the "SAVE" button to confirm and add the new expense
d.click(16, 335)

# Verify that the total monthly expenses have been updated to include the new expense
assert d(resourceId="luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month").get_text() == "$1260.00"
···

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the "SAVE" button using the provided coordinates.
2. Asserts that the total monthly expenses displayed matches the expected value of "$1260.00".

1. We have successfully added a new expense with the description "books" and amount "100".
2. The next step in the source test case is to verify that a new table row is displayed, representing the added expense.
3. In the target app, expenses are displayed in a ListView instead of a TableRow.
4. Therefore, we're asserting that the ListView with the ID "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/listView" is displayed, which should contain the newly added expense.

This assertion corresponds to step 7 in the source test case, adapting it to the structure of the target application. If this assertion passes, we can proceed to verify the specific content of the newly added expense in the next step.
Based on the provided input, I'll convert the ASSERT action into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the conversion:

···
assert d(resourceId="luankevinferreira.expenses:id/listView").exists(), "ListView containing expense entries is not displayed"
···

This code checks if the ListView with the specified resource ID exists, which verifies that it is displayed on the screen. The `exists()` method is used to check for the presence of the element, and an assertion is raised if it's not found.

Based on the provided information, I can see that we have successfully migrated steps 3 through 6 of the source test case. We have added a new expense with the description "books" and the amount "100". Now, we need to verify that the new expense is displayed correctly. Let's proceed with the next step:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.ListView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/listView, (0, 0), containsItem, "books"):Verify that the ListView contains the newly added expense with the description "books"
~~~

This assertion corresponds to step 7 in the source test case, where we verify that a new table row (in this case, a list item) is displayed representing the added expense. We're checking if the ListView contains an item with the description "books".
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to verify that the ListView contains the newly added expense with the description "books":

···
assert d(resourceId="luankevinferreira.expenses:id/listView").child(text="books").exists()
···

This code does the following:
1. It uses the device variable name 'd' as specified.
2. It targets the ListView using its resource ID.
3. It checks for the existence of a child element with the text "books" within the ListView.
4. The assert statement will raise an exception if the condition is not met, effectively verifying the presence of the "books" item in the list.

This approach is more reliable than using coordinates, as it directly checks for the presence of the specific text within the ListView, regardless of its exact position.

Based on the provided information, I can see that we have successfully migrated several steps of the source test case to the target application. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next step:

1. We have already added a new expense with the description "books" and the amount "100".
2. We have verified that the total monthly expenses have been updated.
3. We have confirmed that the ListView containing expense entries is displayed.
4. We have verified that the newly added expense with the description "books" is in the ListView.

The next step in the source test case is to verify that the added expense is displayed correctly with the text "100 MONTHLY". However, in the target application, we don't see an exact match for this assertion. Instead, we can verify that the newly added expense is displayed correctly in the ListView.

Here's the next action we should take:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.ListView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/listView, (0, 0), containsItem, "100"):Verify that the ListView contains the newly added expense with the amount "100"
~~~

This assertion will check if the ListView contains an item with the amount "100", which corresponds to the expense we just added. This matches the intention of the original test case to verify the correct display of the added expense.

After this assertion, we will have completed all the steps in the source test case. Therefore, we can conclude the test migration.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
assert "100" in d(resourceId="luankevinferreira.expenses:id/listView").child(className="android.widget.TextView").get_text()
···

This code does the following:

1. It uses the device variable 'd' as specified.
2. It targets the ListView with the resourceId "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/listView".
3. It checks if any child TextView of this ListView contains the text "100".
4. The assertion will pass if "100" is found in any of the child TextViews, which verifies that the ListView contains the newly added expense with the amount "100".

This approach is more flexible than using coordinates, as it will work regardless of the exact position of the item in the list. It also doesn't rely on a specific index, which could change if the list order changes.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated the test case for adding a new expense and verifying its display. Let's review the steps we've completed:

1. We clicked on the floating action button to open the expense creation page, which corresponds to step 3 in the source test case.
2. We entered "books" as the expense description, matching step 4.
3. We entered "100" as the expense amount, corresponding to step 5.
4. We clicked the "SAVE" button to add the new expense, aligning with step 6.
5. We verified that the total monthly expenses were updated, which is an additional check not present in the source test case but relevant to the target app.
6. We confirmed that the ListView containing expense entries is displayed, which is similar to step 7 in the source test case.
7. We verified that the newly added expense with the description "books" and amount "100" is present in the ListView, which corresponds to step 8 in the source test case.

Given that we have successfully migrated all steps from the source test case to the target app and performed necessary assertions, we can conclude that the test case migration is complete. Therefore, I will respond with DONE:
