### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), click, "Expenses"): Click on the "Expenses" text to navigate to the expenses page. The page remains unchanged after this action, suggesting it may be the title of the current page and not an interactive element.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), long_click, "Expenses"): Long click on the "Expenses" text to perform an action. The long click does not navigate to a new page or create new visible elements.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (260, 24), click, NULL): Click on More options to open a menu. The menu appears with an item "* ALL *" with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/title".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (260, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click to open more options menu. The action does not navigate to a new page or create new visible elements, suggesting the menu might be a popup or overlay not captured in the JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month_description, (16, 96), click, "Total of month expenses"): Click on the total month description. This action does not navigate to a new page or show new widgets, as the Current Page JSON and Next Page JSON are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month_description, (16, 96), long_click, "Total of month expenses"): Long click on the total month description. This action does not lead to any visible changes in the UI or navigation to a new page.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), click, "$0.00"): Click to view the expenses history. The next page shows a monthly expense history view with navigation buttons (prev_button, next_button) and a total expense display (total_history).
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), long_click, "$0.00"): Long click on the total month expenses button to view the expenses history. This action navigates to a new page with a title "Expenses history", showing the current month's expenses and navigation buttons for previous and next months.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab, (248, 568), click, NULL): Click to open the expense creation page. The new page contains input fields for expense value (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value), description (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description), date picker (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/date_picker), expense type spinner (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_type), and a save button (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense).

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with opening the navigation drawer, but the current page's intentions don't show a direct way to do this. However, we can see that there's an option to open a menu, which might lead us to the navigation drawer or similar functionality. Let's start with this action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (260, 24), click, NULL):Click on More options to open a menu
~~~

This action attempts to open a menu, which might contain options similar to those in the navigation drawer of the source application. We'll need to see the result of this action to determine our next step in the migration process.
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(260, 24)
···

This code uses the coordinates (260, 24) to click on the "More options" ImageView, which should open a menu. Since the coordinates are provided and precise, this is the optimal choice for interaction according to the given requirements.

#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (120, 24), click, NULL): Click to open the category selection menu. Clicking this control does not navigate to a new page, but likely triggers a dropdown or dialog to select expense categories.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (120, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click on the LinearLayout containing "* ALL *" text. This action does not navigate to a new page or show new widgets, suggesting it might trigger a contextual action or have no visible effect in the current UI state.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/title, (136, 37), click, "* ALL *"): Click to open the expense category selection menu. The page remains the same after clicking, with the total month expenses view (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month) and add expense button (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab) still visible.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/title, (136, 37), long_click, "* ALL *"): Long click to open a context menu or perform an action related to the "* ALL *" category. The action does not navigate to a new page, but may trigger additional options or functionality within the current view.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to open the navigation drawer, but in the target app, we've already clicked on a "More options" menu. This suggests that the navigation structure might be different in the target app. Let's proceed with the next logical step to find the currency change option.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (), click, NULL):Click on the menu item that leads to settings or currency options
~~~

This action attempts to navigate to the settings or currency options, which aligns with the overall goal of the source test case. We're assuming that the "More options" menu might contain a way to access these settings. If this action is successful, we'll be able to proceed with finding the currency change option in the next step.
Based on the provided action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to click on the menu item that leads to settings or currency options:

···
d.click(540, 88)
···

This code assumes that the menu item is located at the coordinates (540, 88) on the screen. Since no specific coordinates were provided in the input, I've used a common location for a menu item in the top-right corner of the screen. If you have more precise coordinates for this menu item, please provide them, and I'll update the code accordingly.

#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (120, 24), click, NULL): Click to open the category selection menu. Clicking this control does not navigate to a new page, but likely triggers a dropdown or dialog to select expense categories.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (120, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click on the LinearLayout containing "* ALL *" text. This action does not navigate to a new page or show new widgets, suggesting it might trigger a contextual action or have no visible effect in the current UI state.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/title, (136, 37), click, "* ALL *"): Click to open the expense category selection menu. The page remains the same after clicking, with the total month expenses view (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month) and add expense button (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab) still visible.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/title, (136, 37), long_click, "* ALL *"): Long click to open a context menu or perform an action related to the "* ALL *" category. The action does not navigate to a new page, but may trigger additional options or functionality within the current view.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears we are currently at step 3 of the source test case, which involves changing the currency. The executed actions so far have opened the options menu and navigated to what is likely the settings or currency options page. The next logical step would be to find and click on a "Change currency" button or a similar option. However, the current page's intent description doesn't explicitly mention such a button.

Given this situation, I'll propose the most likely next action based on the available information:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (), click, NULL):Click on the option to change currency or access currency settings
~~~

This action attempts to find and click on a TextView that might represent the "Change currency" option or something similar. If this action is successful, we can proceed to the next step. If it fails, we may need to explore other options or consider that the currency change functionality might be structured differently in this app compared to the source app.
Based on the provided action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to click on the option to change currency or access currency settings:

···
d(text="Currency").click()
···

This code assumes that there's a TextView with the text "Currency" that needs to be clicked. Since no specific coordinates or resource ID were provided, we're using the text attribute to locate and interact with the element. This approach is generally reliable when the text is unique and confirmed.

If you have more precise coordinates or a unique resource ID for this element in the future, those would be preferred for more robust automation.

#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (120, 24), click, NULL): Click to open the category selection menu. Clicking this control does not navigate to a new page, but likely triggers a dropdown or dialog to select expense categories.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (120, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click on the LinearLayout containing "* ALL *" text. This action does not navigate to a new page or show new widgets, suggesting it might trigger a contextual action or have no visible effect in the current UI state.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/title, (136, 37), click, "* ALL *"): Click to open the expense category selection menu. The page remains the same after clicking, with the total month expenses view (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month) and add expense button (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab) still visible.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/title, (136, 37), long_click, "* ALL *"): Long click to open a context menu or perform an action related to the "* ALL *" category. The action does not navigate to a new page, but may trigger additional options or functionality within the current view.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently at the step of changing the currency in the target application. The last executed action failed, which suggests that the currency change option might not be directly accessible from the current menu. Let's try to navigate to a settings page where we might find the currency change option.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (), click, NULL):Click on the "Settings" or similar option to access the app settings
~~~

This action attempts to navigate to the settings page where we expect to find the currency change option. We're adapting to the target app's structure, which might require an additional step to reach the currency settings compared to the source app.
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

```
d(text="Settings").click()
```

This code will click on the "Settings" text element in the app. I've used the text attribute as it's the most reliable method given in this case, since we don't have specific coordinates or a unique ID provided. The UIAutomator2 will search for and click on the first element with the text "Settings".

ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (120, 24), click, NULL): Click to open the category selection menu. Clicking this control does not navigate to a new page, but likely triggers a dropdown or dialog to select expense categories.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (120, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click on the LinearLayout containing "* ALL *" text. This action does not navigate to a new page or show new widgets, suggesting it might trigger a contextual action or have no visible effect in the current UI state.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/title, (136, 37), click, "* ALL *"): Click to open the expense category selection menu. The page remains the same after clicking, with the total month expenses view (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month) and add expense button (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab) still visible.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/title, (136, 37), long_click, "* ALL *"): Long click to open a context menu or perform an action related to the "* ALL *" category. The action does not navigate to a new page, but may trigger additional options or functionality within the current view.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently attempting to navigate to the currency change settings in the target application. However, the last two actions have failed to execute successfully. Let's try a different approach to locate the currency settings.

Given that we've already opened the "More options" menu and clicked on a menu item, but haven't successfully reached the currency settings, we should explore other options within the current view. Let's try to find a more specific option related to currency or settings.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (), click, NULL):Click on an option that might lead to currency settings or general app settings
~~~

This action aims to find and click on a menu item that could potentially lead us to the currency settings. We're looking for options like "Settings", "Preferences", "Currency", or anything similar that might contain the currency change functionality.
Based on the given action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to click on an option that might lead to currency settings or general app settings:

```
d.click(540, 960)
```

I've used a generic coordinate (540, 960) which represents the center of a typical Android screen. This is because the exact coordinates weren't provided in the action description. In a real scenario, you would want to use more precise coordinates that correspond to the actual location of the settings option on the screen.

If you have more specific information about the location or identifier of this option, please provide it, and I can give you a more accurate code snippet.

ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (120, 24), click, NULL): Click to open the category selection menu. Clicking this control does not navigate to a new page, but likely triggers a dropdown or dialog to select expense categories.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (120, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click on the LinearLayout containing "* ALL *" text. This action does not navigate to a new page or show new widgets, suggesting it might trigger a contextual action or have no visible effect in the current UI state.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/title, (136, 37), click, "* ALL *"): Click to open the expense category selection menu. The page remains the same after clicking, with the total month expenses view (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month) and add expense button (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab) still visible.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/title, (136, 37), long_click, "* ALL *"): Long click to open a context menu or perform an action related to the "* ALL *" category. The action does not navigate to a new page, but may trigger additional options or functionality within the current view.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently in the process of navigating to the currency change settings. Let's analyze the situation and determine the next appropriate action:

1. We've successfully clicked on the "More options" menu.
2. We've clicked on a menu item that likely leads to settings or currency options.
3. We've attempted to click on a direct currency change option, but it failed.
4. We've attempted to click on a "Settings" option, but it also failed.
5. We've successfully clicked on an option that might lead to currency settings or general app settings.

Given that we're now likely in a settings menu, the next logical step would be to look for a currency-related option. Since we don't have specific information about the current page's intentions related to currency settings, we'll need to make an educated guess based on common app designs.

Here's the suggested next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (), click, NULL):Click on an option related to currency, locale, or regional settings
~~~

This action attempts to find and click on a text-based option that could lead us to the currency change functionality. If this action is successful, we'll be one step closer to matching step 3 of the source test case ("Click on the 'Change currency' button"). If it fails, we'll need to reassess and try a different approach in the next iteration.
Based on the provided action, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

```
d.click(540, 960)
```

I've used a click operation with estimated coordinates (540, 960) as the center point of the screen, which is a common location for such options. Since no specific coordinates or unique identifiers were provided, this is a general approach to interact with the described element. If more precise information becomes available, we can adjust the coordinates or use a more specific selector method.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently in the process of changing the currency settings in the target application. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next step:

1. We have successfully opened the More options menu.
2. We have navigated through some menu items, likely reaching the settings or currency-related options.
3. The last two successful actions suggest that we are getting closer to the currency settings.

Given that the source test case is looking to change the currency, and we seem to be in the right area of the settings, the next logical step would be to look for and interact with a specific currency option. Here's what I propose as the next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (), click, NULL):Click on a specific currency option or a "Change currency" button
~~~

This action aims to select a specific currency or open a currency selection dialog, which aligns with step 3 and 4 of the source test case. If this action is successful, we'll be ready to select a specific currency in the next step.
Based on the provided action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code to click on a specific currency option or a "Change currency" button:

···
d(text="Change currency").click()
···

This code assumes that there's a TextView with the text "Change currency" visible on the screen. If this text is not present or if you have more specific coordinates, please provide that information, and I can adjust the code accordingly.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we are in the process of migrating a test case for changing the currency in an expense tracker application. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next step:

1. We've successfully opened the More options menu.
2. We've navigated through some menu items, presumably trying to reach the currency settings.
3. The last successful action was clicking on an option related to currency, locale, or regional settings.
4. The most recent action, attempting to click on a specific currency option or "Change currency" button, failed.

Given that the last action failed, it's possible that the currency selection interface in the target app is different from the source app. The current page's intent description doesn't show any direct currency-related options, which suggests we might need to take a different approach or explore other options.

Let's try to find an alternative way to change the currency or verify the current currency setting:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/title, (136, 37), click, "* ALL *"):Click to open the expense category selection menu, which might reveal more options or information about the current currency setting
~~~

This action aims to open the expense category selection menu, which might provide more context about the current currency setting or reveal additional options. If this action is successful, we can then look for currency-related information or options in the resulting view.
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

```
d.click(136, 37)
```

This code will perform a click action at the coordinates (136, 37), which corresponds to the TextView with the text "* ALL *" in the expense category selection menu. This action should open the menu, potentially revealing more options or information about the current currency setting.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), click, "Expenses"): Click on the "Expenses" text to navigate to the expenses page. The page remains unchanged after this action, suggesting it may be the title of the current page and not an interactive element.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), long_click, "Expenses"): Long click on the "Expenses" text to perform an action. The long click does not navigate to a new page or create new visible elements.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (260, 24), click, NULL): Click on More options to open a menu. The menu appears with an item "* ALL *" with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/title".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (260, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click to open more options menu. The action does not navigate to a new page or create new visible elements, suggesting the menu might be a popup or overlay not captured in the JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month_description, (16, 96), click, "Total of month expenses"): Click on the total month description. This action does not navigate to a new page or show new widgets, as the Current Page JSON and Next Page JSON are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month_description, (16, 96), long_click, "Total of month expenses"): Long click on the total month description. This action does not lead to any visible changes in the UI or navigation to a new page.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), click, "$0.00"): Click to view the expenses history. The next page shows a monthly expense history view with navigation buttons (prev_button, next_button) and a total expense display (total_history).
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), long_click, "$0.00"): Long click on the total month expenses button to view the expenses history. This action navigates to a new page with a title "Expenses history", showing the current month's expenses and navigation buttons for previous and next months.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently trying to navigate to the currency change functionality in the target application. However, the path to this functionality seems to differ from the source application. Let's analyze the current situation and decide on the next step:

1. We've opened the "More options" menu.
2. We've navigated through a few menu options, possibly reaching a settings-related page.
3. We've clicked on an option related to currency or regional settings.
4. The last action opened an expense category selection menu.

Given that we haven't found a direct "Change currency" option, we might need to explore further or consider if the currency change functionality is integrated differently in this app. Let's try to find a more specific setting or return to a previous menu to explore other options.

Here's the suggested next action:

~~~
RETURN:Go back to the previous menu to explore other options for currency settings
~~~

This action will take us back to the previous menu, allowing us to look for other potential paths to the currency settings. If this doesn't lead us to the desired functionality, we may need to reassess our approach or consider if the currency change feature is implemented differently in this target application.
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.press('back')
···

This code uses the device variable 'd' as specified in the device variable name. The RETURN action is translated into a simple 'back' press, which is the standard way to navigate back to the previous menu in Android applications.
