~~~

Explanation:
1. The source test case's first step is to open the navigation drawer, which has already been executed successfully.
2. The second step in the source test case is to click on the 5th item in the navigation drawer (index 4).
3. In the target app, based on the provided intentions, the "Settings" option is located at the bottom of the navigation drawer, which likely corresponds to the 5th or 6th item.
4. The action to click on "Settings" matches both functionally and in terms of action type (click) with the source test case.

This action should navigate to the Settings page, where we can proceed with the next steps of the test case.
Based on the provided action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(16, 452)

Based on the provided information, we are currently at the Settings page of the target application. Let's proceed with the next step of the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/summary, (16, 192), click, "AFN"):Click on the default currency setting to open a dialog for selecting a new default currency
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already navigated to the Settings page, which corresponds to steps 1 and 2 of the source test case.
2. The next step in the source test case is to click on the "Change currency" button.
3. In the target app, we don't see a specific "Change currency" button, but we do have a default currency setting that can be clicked to change the currency.
4. The intention description shows that clicking on this element opens a dialog for selecting a new default currency, which aligns with the purpose of the source test case.

This action should open a dialog with currency options, allowing us to proceed with selecting a new currency in the next step.
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

```
d.click(16, 192)
```

This code uses the coordinates (16, 192) to click on the default currency setting, which should open a dialog for selecting a new default currency. The coordinates method is preferred as per the requirements, and it's the most straightforward approach in this case.

Based on the provided information, we are currently at step 3 of the source test case, where we need to select a new currency. The executed actions so far have successfully navigated to the Settings page and opened the currency selection dialog. Now, we need to select the third currency option from the list, which corresponds to step 4 in the source test case.

Let's proceed with the next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, android:id/select_dialog_listview, (16, 94), click, NULL):Click to select the third currency option from the list
~~~

This action aims to click on the currency list, which should allow us to select a specific currency. In the next step, we'll need to verify if the selected currency matches the expected one (€) from the source test case.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(16, 94)

Based on the provided information, we are currently at step 4 of the source test case, which involves selecting the third currency option from the list. The executed action sequence shows that we have successfully navigated to the currency selection dialog and clicked on the list view. Now, we need to select the specific currency option. Here's the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 94), click, "AMD"):Click to select AMD as the default currency, which corresponds to the third currency option in the list
~~~

This action attempts to select the third currency option (AMD) from the list, matching the source test case's step of selecting the third currency option. Note that the specific currency might differ between the source and target apps, but we're focusing on selecting the third option as per the original test case.
Based on the provided action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

```
d.click(16, 94)
```

This code uses the coordinates (16, 94) to click on the "AMD" option in the currency selection list. Since the coordinates are precise, we prefer using them over other methods for better reliability and performance.

Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've successfully navigated to the Settings page.
2. We've opened the currency selection dialog.
3. We've selected the third currency option (AMD) from the list.

The next step in the source test case is to verify that the selected currency text displays "Selected currency: €". However, in our target app, we've selected AMD instead of €. We need to verify if the currency change has been applied correctly.

Since we don't have a direct "OK" or "Apply" button visible in the current page's intentions, it's possible that the selection is automatically applied when a currency is clicked. Let's verify this by checking if we've returned to the Settings page and if the selected currency is displayed correctly.

Here's the next step in our migration:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/summary, (16, 192), matches, "AMD"):Verify that the selected currency (AMD) is displayed in the Settings page
~~~

This assertion will check if the currency change has been applied correctly. If this assertion passes, we can consider this step of the test case migration complete. If it fails, we might need to look for additional steps to apply the currency change or consider alternative approaches.
Based on the provided action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

```
assert d(resourceId="android:id/summary", text="AMD").exists()
```

This code verifies that a TextView with the resource ID "android:id/summary" and text "AMD" exists on the screen, which corresponds to the assertion that the selected currency (AMD) is displayed in the Settings page.

Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've successfully navigated to the Settings page.
2. We've opened the currency selection dialog.
3. We've selected the third currency option (AMD) from the list.
4. We've verified that AMD is now displayed as the selected currency in the Settings page.

The next step in the source test case is to verify that the selected currency text displays "Selected currency: €". However, in our target app, we've already selected AMD instead of €, and we've verified that AMD is displayed in the Settings page.

Given that the functionality is similar (changing the currency) but the specific currency and display format differ, we should adapt our assertion to match the target app's behavior. Here's the next step in our migration:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/summary, (16, 192), matches, "AMD"):Verify that the selected currency (AMD) is displayed correctly in the Settings page
~~~

This assertion confirms that the currency change has been applied correctly, adapting to the specific implementation of the target app. We've now completed all the steps from the source test case, so we can conclude the migration.
