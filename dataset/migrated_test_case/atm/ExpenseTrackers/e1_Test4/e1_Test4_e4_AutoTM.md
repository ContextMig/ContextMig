#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with clicking on a floating action button to expand the menu. In the target application, we don't see a floating action button, but we do have buttons for adding income and expenses. Since the source test case is about adding a new income entry, we should choose the "ADD INCOME" button. Here's the next step for the migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/btn_add_income, (0, 589), click, NULL):Click to open the Add Income page to start adding a new income entry
~~~

This action corresponds to the first two steps of the source test case (expanding the menu and clicking on the new expense button), as it directly opens the form for adding a new income entry.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(0, 589)
···

This code uses the coordinate-based click method as per the preference for using coordinates when they are precise. The action is to click on the "Add Income" button located at coordinates (0, 589) to open the Add Income page.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case has been completed, as we've navigated to the Add Income page. Let's proceed with the next step of the migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_price, (16, 164), click, NULL):Click to focus on the price input field for entering the amount
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_price, (16, 164), input, "60"):Enter "60" as the amount for the new income entry
~~~

This action corresponds to step 4 in the source test case, where we input the amount. We've combined the click action to focus on the field with the input action to enter the value. We're entering the amount before the description because the price field appears earlier in the target app's layout.
Based on the provided actions, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(16, 164)
d(resourceId="com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_price").set_text("60")
···

This code first clicks on the price input field using the provided coordinates (16, 164) to focus on it. Then, it uses the resourceId to locate the EditText element and sets its text to "60".

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll continue with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_title, (16, 221), click, NULL):Click to focus on the Title input field for entering the title of the income transaction
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_title, (16, 221), input, "income"):Enter "income" as the description for the new entry
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already completed steps 1-2 of the source test case by opening the Add Income page and entering the amount.
2. The next step in the source test case is to enter "income" as the description.
3. In the target app, we need to focus on the Title input field first, then enter the text.
4. The Title input field in the target app corresponds to the description field in the source test case.
5. We use the click action to focus on the field, then use the input action to enter the text "income".

This step combines steps 3 and 4 from the source test case, adapting them to the structure of the target app.
Based on the provided actions, I'll convert them into UIAutomator2 code using Python. Here's the corresponding code:

···
d.click(16, 221)
d(resourceId="com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_title").set_text("income")
···

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the coordinates (16, 221) to focus on the Title input field.
2. Uses the resource ID to set the text "income" in the Title input field.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I can see that we have already completed several steps of the test case migration. Let's proceed with the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/action_done, (272, 28), click, NULL):Click to add the income and save the new income entry
~~~

This action corresponds to step 6 in the source test case: "Click on the save button to add the new income entry." In the target app, we're using the "action_done" TextView to save the income entry, which serves the same purpose as the "save_expense_fab" in the source app.

After this action, we should be able to verify if the new income entry has been added correctly. The next steps would involve asserting the presence and correctness of the newly added entry, but we'll need to wait for the result of this action and the updated page intentions before proceeding with those steps.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(272, 28)
···

This code uses the coordinate-based click method as specified in the requirements. The action is to click on the "action_done" element, which is described as a TextView with the given resource ID. However, since coordinates are provided and are preferred according to the instructions, the code uses the direct click method with the given x and y coordinates (272, 28).
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (24, 217), click, "Do you like MoneyTracker?"): Click on the text asking if the user likes MoneyTracker. The action does not lead to a new page or new elements; the same dialog with options to rate the app remains visible.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (24, 217), long_click, "Do you like MoneyTracker?"): Long click on the "Do you like MoneyTracker?" text to dismiss the rating dialog and return to the Add income page. The Add income page contains input fields for Date, Time, Account, Price, Title, and Category.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (63, 261), click, "Rate it on Google Play!"): Click to dismiss the rating dialog and return to the 'Add income' page. The next page contains input fields for Date, Time, Account, Price, Title, and Category.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (63, 261), long_click, "Rate it on Google Play!"): Long click on "Rate it on Google Play!" text to possibly open Google Play store rating page. The action doesn't navigate to a new page, but returns to the previous "Add income" page with fields for Date, Time, Account, Price, Title, and Category.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/yes_button, (24, 300), click, "YES!"): Click to rate the app on Google Play. The page after clicking returns to the Add income page, which has a date field with id "com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/tv_date", a time field with id "com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/tv_time", and an account spinner with id "com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/spinner_account".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/yes_button, (24, 300), longClick, "YES!"): Long click on the "YES!" button to confirm rating the app on Google Play. This action closes the rating dialog and returns to the previous page as there are no new elements in the Next Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/maybeButton, (24, 349), click, "MAYBE LATER"): Click to dismiss the rating prompt and return to the add income page, which contains input fields for date, time, account, price, title, and category.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/maybeButton, (24, 349), longclick, "MAYBE LATER"): Long click on "MAYBE LATER" button to dismiss the rating dialog and return to the "Add income" page, which contains input fields for date, time, account, price, title, and category.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/thanksButton, (24, 398), click, "NO, THANK YOU"): Click to dismiss the rating dialog and return to the previous page for adding income. The next page shows the add income form with fields for date, time, account, price, title, and category.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/thanksButton, (24, 398), long_click, "NO, THANK YOU"): Long click on "NO, THANK YOU" button to dismiss the rating dialog and return to the Add income page with updated time (23:27) and an error message "Field can't be empty." for the Category field.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated the main steps of adding a new income entry. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next step:

1. We've opened the Add Income page.
2. We've entered the amount "60" in the price field.
3. We've entered "income" as the title/description.
4. We've saved the new income entry.

These steps correspond to steps 3, 4, and 6 of the source test case. We've skipped steps 1 and 2 as they were not necessary in the target app, and step 5 (changing from expense to income) was not needed as we were already on the Add Income page.

The next logical step would be to verify that the newly added income entry is displayed correctly, which corresponds to steps 7 and 8 of the source test case. However, based on the current page's intent description, we seem to be on a rating dialog page rather than the main page where we would expect to see the newly added entry.

Given this situation, we should first dismiss the rating dialog to return to the main page where we can verify the new entry. Let's choose the option that allows us to return to the main page without rating:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/thanksButton, (24, 398), click, "NO, THANK YOU"):Click to dismiss the rating dialog and return to the previous page for adding income
~~~

This action should take us back to the main page where we can verify the newly added income entry. After executing this action, we should be able to proceed with the verification steps in the next interaction.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(24, 398)
···

This code uses the coordinates (24, 398) to click on the "NO, THANK YOU" button, which dismisses the rating dialog and returns to the previous page for adding income. Using coordinates is the optimal choice as per the requirements, and it's the most precise way to interact with the specific UI element.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided information, I can see that we have successfully migrated several steps of the source test case to the target application. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next step:

1. We have added a new income entry with the amount "60" and description "income".
2. We have saved this entry.
3. A rating dialog appeared, which we dismissed.

The next logical step would be to verify if the newly added income entry is displayed correctly on the main page. This corresponds to steps 7 and 8 in the source test case. However, we need to first navigate back to the main page where the entries are listed.

Here's the next action I suggest:

~~~
RETURN:Navigate back to the main page to view the list of entries
~~~

This action will take us back to the main page where we can then verify if the newly added income entry is displayed correctly.
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.press('back')
···

This code uses the device variable 'd' as specified in the device variable name, and performs a back navigation action to return to the main page where the list of entries can be viewed.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've successfully added an income entry with the amount "60" and title "income".
2. We've returned to the main page where the list of entries should be visible.
3. The next logical step would be to verify if the newly added income entry is displayed correctly.

Given this, here's the next action for the test case migration:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (), matches, "income"):Verify that the title of the newly added entry is displayed as "income"
~~~

This assertion aims to check if the title "income" is visible on the main page, corresponding to step 7 in the source test case. If this assertion passes, we can proceed to verify the amount in the next step.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the given action:

···
assert d(className="android.widget.TextView", text="income").exists()
···

This code verifies that a TextView with the text "income" exists on the screen, which corresponds to checking if the title of the newly added entry is displayed as "income". The `exists()` method is used to check for the presence of the element, and the assertion will fail if the element is not found.

ACTION (TextInputLayout, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/til_price, (16, 153), longclick, "Price"): Long click on the Price input field. The action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes in the UI. The date has changed from "2024-08-27" to "2024-08-28" and the time from "23:52" to "00:00", which appears to be due to the passage of time rather than the long click action.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_price, (16, 164), click, "60"): Click to edit the price value. The page remains the same, but the focus is now on the price input field, allowing the user to modify the amount.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated most of the steps from the source test case to the target application. Let's review the current status and determine the next action:

1. We've added a new income entry with the amount "60" and title "income".
2. We've saved the entry and dismissed a rating dialog.
3. We've returned to the main page and verified that the title "income" is displayed.

The next step should be to verify the amount of the newly added entry. According to the source test case, we need to check if the amount is displayed as "$60.00". Let's proceed with this assertion:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (), matches, "$60.00"):Verify that the amount of the newly added entry is displayed as "$60.00"
~~~

This assertion aims to check if the amount of the newly added income entry is correctly displayed on the main page. If this assertion passes, we will have completed all the steps from the source test case. If it fails, we may need to adjust our approach or investigate why the amount is not displayed as expected.
Based on the given information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the assertion:

···
assert d(text="$60.00").exists()
···

This code checks if there's a TextView element with the exact text "$60.00" on the screen. The assertion will pass if such an element exists, verifying that the amount of the newly added entry is displayed as "$60.00".

ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_category, (16, 278), longClick, NULL): Long click on the category input field to potentially bring up additional options or a context menu for category selection. No new page or dialog appears after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/textinput_error, (20, 324), click, "Field can't be empty."): Click on the error message to acknowledge it. No new page or widgets appear after this action, as the error message is likely just an informative text and not an interactive element.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated the entire test case from the source application to the target application. Let's review the steps:

1. We opened the Add Income page.
2. We entered the price "60".
3. We entered the title "income".
4. We saved the new income entry.
5. We dismissed a rating dialog (which wasn't in the original test case but appeared in the target app).
6. We returned to the main page.
7. We verified the title "income" was displayed.
8. We verified the amount "$60.00" was displayed.

These steps correspond to all the actions in the source test case, with some adaptations for the target app's specific UI and flow. Since we have completed all the steps and performed the necessary assertions, we can conclude that the test case migration is complete.

Therefore, I will respond with:

~~~
DONE

I understand that you're requesting UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given Android test semantic actions. However, you've provided "DONE" in the Actions section, which indicates that there are no specific actions to convert into code.

Without any actual actions to transform, I cannot generate any UIAutomator2 code. If you have specific actions you'd like converted, please provide them in the format you described earlier:

ACTION (element, id, coordinates, action, value):purpose

Once you provide these actions, I'll be happy to convert them into the appropriate UIAutomator2 code using the device variable name 'd' as specified.
