#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided function description and the current page's intent description, I'll start the test case migration process. The first step in the source test case is to open the income input screen. Let's find the corresponding action in the target app.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/btn_add_income, (0, 589), click, NULL):Click to open the "Add income" page
~~~

This action corresponds to the first step in the source test case, which is clicking on the image button to open the income input screen. The target app has a specific "ADD INCOME" button for this purpose.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(0, 589)
···

This code uses the coordinates (0, 589) to perform a click action, which will open the "Add income" page. Using coordinates is the preferred method as specified in the requirements.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in migrating the test case. Here's my analysis and recommendation:

1. We've successfully opened the "Add income" page, which aligns with step 1 of the source test case.
2. The next step in the source test case is to enter the amount "90" into the amount input field.
3. In the target app, we have a price input field that corresponds to this action.

Therefore, I recommend the following action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_price, (16, 164), input, "90"):Enter the amount "90" into the price input field
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 of the source test case, entering the amount into the appropriate field in the target app.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code for the given action:

···
d.click(16, 164)
d(resourceId="com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_price").set_text("90")
···

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (16, 164) to focus on the price input field, and then uses the resource ID to set the text to "90" in the input field.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case semantics, it appears we have successfully completed steps 1 and 2 of the source test case. The next step in the source test case is to enter the note "income" into the note input field. However, in the target application, we don't see a direct equivalent for a note field. Instead, we have a "Title" field which could serve a similar purpose. Let's proceed with entering the note in the Title field.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_title, (16, 221), input, "income"):Enter the note "income" into the title input field
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in the source test case, adapting it to the available fields in the target application. We're using the Title field to enter the note, as it's the closest match to the original note field.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d.click(16, 221)
d(resourceId="com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_title").set_text("income")
···

This code first clicks on the coordinates (16, 221) to focus on the input field, and then uses the resource ID to set the text "income" in the title input field.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've successfully opened the "Add income" page.
2. We've entered the amount "90" into the price input field.
3. We've entered the note "income" into the title input field.

The next logical step in the source test case is to confirm the income entry. However, based on the current page's intent description, we need to add a category before we can successfully add the income. Let's address this:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_category, (16, 278), input, "General"):Enter "General" as the category for the income entry
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/action_done, (272, 28), click, NULL):Click to add the income and confirm the entry
~~~

I've chosen to input "General" as a generic category to allow the income to be added successfully. After inputting the category, we can proceed with confirming the income entry by clicking the "Add" button (which corresponds to the "Done" button in the source test case).
Based on the provided actions, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(16, 278)
d(resourceId="com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_category").set_text("General")
d.click(272, 28)
···

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the EditText field for category input.
2. Sets the text "General" in the category field using its resource ID.
3. Clicks on the "Done" action button to add the income and confirm the entry.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll analyze the current state of the test migration and determine the next step. Let's review the progress:

1. The "Add Income" page has been opened.
2. The amount "90" has been entered into the price field.
3. The note "income" has been entered into the title field.
4. "General" has been entered as the category.
5. The income entry has been confirmed by clicking the "Done" action.

These steps correspond to steps 1-4 of the source test case. The next step in the source test case is to verify the updated balance. Let's proceed with this verification:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/tv_total, (16, 221), matches, "+ 90 NON"):Verify that the total balance shows the updated amount of "+ 90 NON"
~~~

This assertion aims to check if the balance has been updated correctly after adding the income. The element ID and coordinates are based on the information provided in the current page's intent description. The expected value "+ 90 NON" is derived from the amount entered and the currency mentioned in the page description.
Based on the provided input, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the assertion:

···
assert d(resourceId="com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/tv_total").get_text() == "+ 90 NON"
···

This code asserts that the TextView with the resource ID "com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/tv_total" has the text "+ 90 NON". This verifies that the total balance shows the updated amount as specified in the assertion.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I can see that we have successfully migrated the first four steps of the source test case to the target application. Let's proceed with the next step:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/tv_total, (16, 221), matches, "+ 90 NON"):Verify that the total balance shows the updated amount of "+ 90 NON"
~~~

This assertion step corresponds to the final step in the source test case, which was to verify the updated balance. We have successfully matched all steps of the source test case to actions in the target application. Therefore, we can conclude the test migration process.

DONE

Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the provided action:

···
assert d(resourceId="com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/tv_total").get_text() == "+ 90 NON"
···

This code performs an assertion to verify that the total balance shows the updated amount of "+ 90 NON". It uses the resource ID of the TextView to locate the element and checks its text content.
