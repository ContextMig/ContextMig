ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month_description, (16, 96), longClick, "Total of month expenses"): Long click on the total month description. This action does not navigate to a new page or show any new elements, as the Current Page JSON and Next Page JSON are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), click, "$2250.00"): Click to view detailed expense history. The next page shows a list of expenses for August with a total of $2250.00, and includes a ListView with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/listView" containing individual expense items.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), long_click, "$2250.00"): Long click to view the expenses history. This navigates to a new page displaying a list of expenses for the month of August, with options to navigate between months and a total sum at the bottom.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab, (248, 568), click, NULL): Click to open the expense creation page. The new page contains input fields for expense value (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value), description (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description), date picker (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/date_picker), expense type spinner (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_type), and a save button (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense).

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are at the beginning of the test case migration process. The source test case starts with opening the navigation drawer, but the current page's intentions don't show a direct way to do this. However, we can see that there's an "More options" button that might lead to similar functionality. Let's start with this action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (260, 24), click, NULL):Click on the "More options" button to open a popup menu with category filter options, potentially leading to navigation options
~~~

This action aims to open a menu that might contain navigation options similar to the navigation drawer in the source test case. We'll need to see the result of this action to determine our next step in the migration process.
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(260, 24)
···

This code will perform a click action at the coordinates (260, 24), which corresponds to the "More options" button as described in the action. This should open a popup menu with category filter options.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (120, 24), click, NULL): Click to select the "* ALL *" category. This action does not navigate to a new page, but may update the view to show all expenses across categories.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (120, 24), long_click, NULL): Long press on the "* ALL *" category item to potentially access additional options or actions related to this category. The page remains unchanged after this action, suggesting it may trigger a context menu or other UI element not captured in the JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/title, (136, 37), click, "* ALL *"): Click to select the "* ALL *" category. This action closes the category selection menu and returns to the main expenses page, which displays the total monthly expenses and includes a floating action button for adding new expenses.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/title, (136, 37), long_click, "* ALL *"): Long click on "* ALL *" category to close the category selection dialog and return to the main expenses page, which displays the total monthly expenses and has a floating action button with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab".

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. The source test case starts with opening the navigation drawer.
2. The executed action sequence shows that we've clicked on a "More options" button, which opened a popup menu with category filter options.

Although the exact navigation structure is different, it seems we're on the right track to access different sections of the app. The next logical step would be to select an option from this menu that could lead us to a list of expenses, similar to step 2 in the source test case.

Here's the proposed next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/title, (136, 37), click, "* ALL *"):Click to select the "* ALL *" category to view all expenses, which is functionally similar to navigating to the expense list in the source test case
~~~

This action should close the category selection menu and return to the main expenses page, which likely contains a list of all expenses. This would be analogous to step 2 in the source test case where we navigate to a specific section (in this case, all expenses).
Based on the provided action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(136, 37)
···

This code uses the coordinates (136, 37) to click on the "* ALL *" category TextView, which will select it to view all expenses. This action is equivalent to navigating to the expense list in the source test case.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), click, "Expenses"): Click on the "Expenses" text. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes in the UI elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, "", (16, 38), long_click, "Expenses"): Long click on the "Expenses" text to potentially open a context menu or perform an action related to the app's expenses functionality. However, the action does not appear to navigate to a new page or create new visible elements based on the provided Next Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (260, 24), click, NULL): Click on the "More options" button to open a popup menu with category filter options, including "* ALL *" and "Food" categories.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (260, 24), long_click, NULL): Long press on the "More options" button to open a menu with additional actions. The action does not navigate to a new page or create new visible elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month_description, (16, 96), click, "Total of month expenses"): Click on the total month description. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes in the UI.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month_description, (16, 96), longClick, "Total of month expenses"): Long click on the total month description. This action does not navigate to a new page or show any new elements, as the Current Page JSON and Next Page JSON are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), click, "$2250.00"): Click to view detailed expense history. The next page shows a list of expenses for August with a total of $2250.00, and includes a ListView with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/listView" containing individual expense items.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), long_click, "$2250.00"): Long click to view the expenses history. This navigates to a new page displaying a list of expenses for the month of August, with options to navigate between months and a total sum at the bottom.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab, (248, 568), click, NULL): Click to open the expense creation page. The new page contains input fields for expense value (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value), description (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description), date picker (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/date_picker), expense type spinner (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_type), and a save button (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense).
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab, (248, 568), longClick, NULL): Long press to open the expense creation page. The new page contains input fields for expense value (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value), description (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description), date picker (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/date_picker), expense type spinner (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_type), and a save button (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense).

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the appropriate action:

1. We've clicked on the "More options" button and selected the "* ALL *" category, which is functionally similar to navigating to the expense list in the source test case.
2. The next step in the source test case is to click on the first item in the list view.
3. In the current page's intent description, we don't see a direct match for a list view, but we do have a button that shows the total month expenses.

Given this information, the most appropriate next step would be to click on the total month expenses button, which should lead us to a detailed list of expenses. This action aligns with the intention of the source test case to interact with the expense list.

Here's the proposed next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), click, "$2250.00"):Click to view detailed expense history
~~~

This action should navigate us to a page with a list of expenses, which would be similar to the list view in the source test case. From there, we can proceed with the next steps of selecting and deleting an expense.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(16, 126)
···

This code uses the coordinates (16, 126) to perform a click action on the specified button. The coordinate-based approach is preferred as per the requirements, and it's the most precise way to interact with the UI element in this case.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we can proceed with the next step of the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the appropriate action:

1. We've already navigated to the expense list view, which is similar to step 2 in the source test case.
2. The next step in the source test case is to select an item from the list.
3. In the target app, we're currently on the expense history page with a list of expenses.

Given this, the next logical step would be to select an expense item from the list to proceed with the deletion process. Here's the suggested action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (16, 175), click, NULL):Click on the first expense item in the list to view or edit its details
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in the source test case, where we select an item from the list. By clicking on the first expense item, we should be able to access its details or options for editing/deleting, which will allow us to proceed with the deletion process in the next step.
Based on the provided action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to click on the first expense item in the list:

···
d.click(16, 175)
···

This code uses the coordinates (16, 175) to perform a click action, which should select the first expense item in the list as specified in the action description.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've opened the options menu and selected the "ALL" category to view all expenses.
2. We've clicked on the total amount to view the detailed expense history.
3. We've clicked on the first expense item in the list.

The next logical step in the source test case is to delete the expense. However, in the target app, we don't see a direct "Delete" button on the current page. Instead, we need to navigate to the expense editing page to find the delete option.

Here's the next action I suggest:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/line_delete, (21, 180), click, NULL):Click to edit the expense item, which will open the expense editing page where we can find the delete option
~~~

This action will open the expense editing page, where we expect to find a delete option to complete the next step of the test case.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(21, 180)
···

This code uses the coordinates (21, 180) to perform a click action, which is the preferred method as per the requirements. This action will open the expense editing page where the delete option can be found.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've navigated to the expense list and selected an item, which is similar to steps 1-3 in the source test case.
2. We're now on the expense editing page, where we can find the delete option.

The next logical step would be to delete the expense, which corresponds to step 4 in the source test case. Here's the appropriate action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/action_delete, (264, 28), click, NULL):Click to delete the current expense, which will remove it from the list and return to the Expenses history page
~~~

This action matches step 4 of the source test case: "Click on the "Delete" button". After executing this action, we should be back on the Expenses history page, where we can verify if the expense has been deleted.
Based on the provided action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d.click(264, 28)
···

This code uses the coordinates (264, 28) to click on the delete action button. This is the optimal choice as you mentioned that using coordinates is preferred when they are precise. The click action will delete the current expense and return to the Expenses history page as described in the action's purpose.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've navigated to the expense list (similar to steps 1-2 in the source test case).
2. We've selected and opened an expense item for editing (similar to step 3).
3. We've deleted the expense item (similar to step 4).

The next logical step would be to verify if the expense list is empty, which corresponds to step 5 in the source test case. However, we need to adapt this step to the current app's UI and available intentions.

Let's proceed with the verification:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_history, (71, 593), matches, "$0.00"):Verify that the total expense amount is $0.00, indicating that all expenses have been deleted
~~~

This assertion checks if the total expense amount is now $0.00, which would indicate that all expenses have been deleted. This is the closest equivalent to verifying the empty state message in the source test case, given the available intentions on the current page.

If this assertion passes, it would confirm that the deletion was successful and the expense list is empty. If it fails, we might need to consider alternative approaches or additional steps to verify the empty state.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to verify the total expense amount:

···
assert d(resourceId="luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_history").get_text() == "$0.00"
···

This code checks if the text of the TextView with the specified resource ID matches "$0.00", verifying that all expenses have been deleted and the total is zero.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully completed the migration of the source test case to the target application. Let's review the steps:

1. We navigated to the expense list (equivalent to opening the side menu and selecting the third item).
2. We selected an expense item from the list.
3. We deleted the expense item.
4. We verified that the total expense amount is now $0.00, which indicates that all expenses have been deleted.

These steps correspond to the main actions in the source test case. The only step we haven't explicitly covered is verifying the empty state message. However, since we've confirmed that the total expense is $0.00, this implicitly suggests that we've reached an empty state.

Given that we've matched all the essential steps from the source test case, and there are no more actions to perform, I believe we can conclude this test case migration.

Here's the response to indicate that we've completed the migration:

~~~
DONE

This response signifies that we have successfully migrated all steps of the source test case to the target application, taking into account the differences in UI and operation logic between the two apps.
Thank you for providing the device variable name and the actions. However, it seems that no specific actions were provided in your input. The "DONE" at the end indicates that there are no actions to convert into UIAutomator2 code.

If you have any specific actions you'd like to convert, please provide them in the format described earlier:

ACTION (element, id, coordinates, action, value):purpose

Once you provide the actions, I'll be happy to assist you in converting them into UIAutomator2 code in Python.
