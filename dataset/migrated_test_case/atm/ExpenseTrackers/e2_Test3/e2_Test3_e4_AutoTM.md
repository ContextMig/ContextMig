#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided function description of the source test case and the current page's intent description, we can start the test migration process. The first step in the source test case is to click on a floating action button to add a new expense. In the target application, we have a similar functionality with the "ADD EXPENSE" button. Let's start with this action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/btn_add_expense, (160, 589), click, NULL):Click to open the Add expense page
~~~

This action should open the Add expense page, which aligns with the first step of our source test case. After executing this action, we should be presented with a page containing input fields for the expense details.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d.click(160, 589)
```

This code uses the coordinates (160, 589) to click on the "Add expense" button, which opens the Add expense page. As per the requirements, I've prioritized using coordinates for the action since they are provided and precise.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in migrating the test case. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've successfully opened the "Add expense" page by clicking the "Add expense" button.
2. The next step in the source test case is to enter the expense value of 45.

Given the current page's intentions, we can see that there's an input field for the price. Let's proceed with entering the expense value.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_price, (16, 164), input, "45"): Enter the expense value of 45 in the price input field.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 in the source test case: "ACTION (EditText, R.id.expense_value, (), input, "45"): Enter the expense value of 45."

We're using the price input field in the target app to enter the expense value, which aligns with the functionality we're testing. The element ID and coordinates are different from the source test case, but that's expected as we're working with a different app.
Based on the given action and requirements, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(16, 164)
d(resourceId="com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_price").set_text("45")
···

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (16, 164) to focus on the input field, and then uses the resource ID to set the text to "45" in the price input field.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I will proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We have successfully opened the Add expense page.
2. We have entered the expense value of 45 in the price input field.

The next step in the source test case is to enter the expense description as "restaurant". In the target app, this corresponds to entering the title of the expense. Here's the next action to take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_title, (16, 221), input, "restaurant"):Enter the expense description as "restaurant" in the title input field.
~~~

This action aligns with step 3 of the source test case, where we input the expense description. In the target app, we're using the title field for this purpose, as it seems to be the equivalent of the description field in the source app.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the provided action:

```
d.click(16, 221)
d(resourceId="com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_title").set_text("restaurant")
```

This code first clicks on the coordinates (16, 221) to focus on the input field, and then uses the resourceId to set the text "restaurant" in the title input field.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've successfully opened the Add expense page.
2. We've entered the expense value of 45.
3. We've entered the expense description as "restaurant".

The next step in the source test case is to select a date. In the target app, we can see that there's a date field available. Let's proceed with this step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/tv_date, (16, 113), click, "2024-08-30"):Click to open date picker dialog to select the date for the expense.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 4 in the source test case: "Click on the date picker button to open the date selection dialog." The next step would be to confirm the date selection, but we'll wait for the result of this action before proceeding further.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(16, 113)
···

This code uses the coordinates (16, 113) to click on the TextView element, which opens the date picker dialog to select the date for the expense. The coordinates are preferred as they are precise and available in the input.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently at step 4 of the source test case, which involves selecting a date for the expense. The date picker dialog has been opened, and we need to confirm the date selection. Let's proceed with the next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (228, 524), click, "OK"):Click to confirm the selected date (2024-08-30) for the expense and return to the expense creation page.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 5 in the source test case, where we confirm the date selection. By clicking the "OK" button, we are confirming the date (2024-08-30) that was pre-selected when the date picker was opened. This action will close the date picker dialog and return to the expense creation page, updating the date field with the selected date.
Based on the provided action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(228, 524)
···

This code uses the coordinates (228, 524) to click the "OK" button, which confirms the selected date (2024-08-30) for the expense and returns to the expense creation page. Using coordinates is the preferred method as per the requirements, and it's the most precise way to interact with the specific UI element in this case.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I will continue with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We have successfully added the expense value (45) and description (restaurant).
2. We have also selected and confirmed the date for the expense.

The next logical step in the source test case is to save the expense. Let's look at the current page's intentions to find the appropriate action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/action_done, (272, 28), click, NULL): Click to save the edited expense. The page after clicking this control is the add expense page, which has a new "Add expense" title and empty fields for entering a new expense.
~~~

This action seems to correspond to the "Save" button in the source test case. Let's use this to save the expense:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/action_done, (272, 28), click, NULL): Click to save the newly added expense.
~~~

This action should complete the expense addition process. After this, we would need to verify the total monthly expense, but we don't have that information in the current page's intentions. We might need to navigate to a different page to find this information in the next step.
Based on the provided actions, I'll convert them into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the implementation:

···
# Click to save the edited expense
d.click(272, 28)

# Click to save the newly added expense
d.click(272, 28)
···

This code uses the coordinates provided in the actions to perform the clicks. Both actions are identical in terms of the UI element and coordinates, so the same code is used for both. The clicks are performed on the 'action_done' TextView at the coordinates (272, 28).
````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), click, NULL):Click on the "Navigate up" button to return to the previous screen, which is the Records page showing a list of financial transactions, summary information, and options to add income or expense.
~~~

Explanation:
1. We have completed steps 1-6 of the source test case, which involve adding a new expense.
2. The last executed action was clicking the "done" button to save the expense.
3. The next step in the source test case (step 7) is to verify the total monthly expense.
4. However, based on the current page's intentions, we are still on the add expense page. We need to navigate back to the Records page to see the updated total.
5. The most appropriate action to achieve this is to use the "Navigate up" button, which will take us back to the Records page where we can see the list of transactions and potentially the total monthly expense.

This action aligns with the functional similarity of returning to the main view where we can verify the total expense, even though it's not explicitly mentioned in the source test case. The next step would likely involve finding and verifying the total monthly expense on the Records page.
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

```
d.click(0, 24)
```

This code will click on the "Navigate up" button located at the coordinates (0, 24) to return to the previous screen (Records page) as described in the action.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've successfully added an expense of 45 for "restaurant" on the date 2024-08-30.
2. We've returned to the main Records page.
3. The next step in the source test case is to verify the total monthly expense.

Given this, here's the next action we should take:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/tv_total, (16, 221), matches, "- 45 NON"):Verify that the total expense displayed is "- 45 NON", which corresponds to the newly added expense.
~~~

This assertion checks if the total expense on the main page reflects the newly added expense of 45. Note that the currency is displayed as "NON" in the target app, which might be different from the source app's "$" display. The negative sign indicates that it's an expense.

If this assertion passes, we can consider the test case migration complete. If it fails, we might need to investigate further or consider additional steps to refresh the display.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the assertion:

···
assert d(resourceId="com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/tv_total").get_text() == "- 45 NON"
···

This code uses the resourceId to locate the TextView element and verifies that its text matches the expected value "- 45 NON". This approach is more reliable than using coordinates, as it directly targets the specific UI element we're interested in.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case semantics, it appears that we have successfully migrated most of the steps. Let's review the progress and determine the next action:

1. We've added a new expense (45 for restaurant).
2. We've selected a date (although it was done slightly differently).
3. We've saved the expense.
4. We've verified the total expense (although the format is slightly different).

The main difference is that the target app uses "NON" as the currency instead of "$". Also, the total is shown as a negative value since it's an expense.

Given that we've completed all the main steps from the source test case, we can conclude that the test case migration is complete. Here's the final assertion and completion statement:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/tv_total, (16, 221), matches, "- 45 NON"):Verify that the total expense displayed is "- 45 NON", which corresponds to the newly added expense.
DONE
~~~

This completes the test case migration. All steps from the source test case have been successfully migrated to the target app, taking into account the differences in currency representation and the negative sign for expenses.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to verify the total expense:

···
assert d(resourceId="com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/tv_total").get_text() == "- 45 NON"
···

This code uses the resourceId to locate the TextView element and verifies that its text matches the expected total expense of "- 45 NON".
