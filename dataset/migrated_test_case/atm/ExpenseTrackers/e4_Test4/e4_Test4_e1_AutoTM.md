#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to click on the thanks button to dismiss the initial screen. However, in the target application, we are already on the main screen with the expanded menu. Let's proceed with the next relevant step, which is adding a new expense.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, NULL, (78, 505), click, "Add expense/income"):Click the "Add expense/income" button to open the expense/income creation page.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 in the source test case: "Click on the add expense button to open the expense entry screen." By clicking on the "Add expense/income" option, we should navigate to a page where we can enter the expense details.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

```
d.click(78, 505)
```

This code will click on the "Add expense/income" button at the coordinates (78, 505) to open the expense/income creation page.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it seems that you are currently at the step of opening the "Add Expense" page in the target application. The executed actions so far align with steps 1 and 2 of the source test case function description.

To proceed with the migration, let's match the next step from the source test case, which is:

```
3. ACTION (TextView, R.id.tv_date, (), click, NULL): Click on the date field to open the date picker.
```

Looking at the current page's intentions, the closest matching action seems to be:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/date_button, (167, 281), click, "AUG 28 2024"):Click on the date button to open the date picker dialog.
~~~

This action appears to serve the same purpose as the source test case step, which is to open the date picker dialog. Therefore, the next step in the migration would be:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/date_button, (167, 281), click, "AUG 28 2024"):Open the date picker dialog
~~~
Based on the provided actions, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(167, 281)
···

This code clicks on the date button to open the date picker dialog. I've used the coordinates (167, 281) as they were provided and are the most precise way to interact with the element. The code is simplified to a single click action since all three described actions essentially perform the same operation of opening the date picker dialog.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we are now at the date picker dialog after clicking on the date field to open it. The next step in the source test case is to click on the "Next month" button twice. Let's proceed with this action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, android:id/next, (242, 192), click, NULL):Click the next month button to navigate to the next month in the date picker dialog.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 4 in the source test case: "Click on the "Next month" button in the date picker." We'll need to perform this action twice to match the source test case.
Based on the provided action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to click the next month button in the date picker dialog:

···
d.click(242, 192)
···

This code uses the coordinates (242, 192) to perform the click action, which is the preferred method as per the requirements. The click action will navigate to the next month in the date picker dialog.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we are in the process of selecting a date for the expense entry. We have successfully navigated to the date picker and moved forward two months, which aligns with steps 3, 4, and 5 of the source test case. The next step in the source test case is to confirm the selected date. Let's proceed with that action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (228, 524), click, "OK"):Click the OK button to confirm the selected date and return to the expense entry screen.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 6 in the source test case: "Click on the "OK" button to confirm the selected date." By clicking the OK button, we are confirming the date selection and should return to the expense entry screen.
Based on the provided input, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d.click(228, 524)
···

This code uses the coordinates (228, 524) to click the OK button, which is the preferred method as per the requirements. The action will confirm the selected date and return to the expense entry screen.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), click, NULL):Navigate back to the previous page. The page after clicking this control is the main page, which has a calendar view with clickable dates and a list of expenses.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears we are currently at the step of entering the expense amount in the target application. Let's proceed with the next action in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/amount_edittext, (30, 170), input, "69.99"):Enter the price "69.99" in the amount field.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 7 in the source test case, where the price "69.99" is entered into the price field. In the target application, we have identified the appropriate field for entering the amount, which has the id "com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/amount_edittext". 

The next step in the source test case involves clicking on the "Add" action menu item. However, in the target application, we don't see a direct equivalent. Instead, we have a save button represented by an ImageButton. So, after entering the amount, we should proceed with saving the expense. But before that, we need to ensure we've entered a description as well, as it's a required field according to the intentions provided.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the action:

···
d.click(30, 170)
d(resourceId="com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/amount_edittext").set_text("69.99")
···

This code first clicks on the coordinates (30, 170) to focus on the input field, and then uses the resourceId to set the text "69.99" in the amount field.
````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we can see that the test case migration has progressed to step 8 of the source test case. The next step in the source test case is to click on the "Add" action menu item to attempt adding the expense. Let's find the corresponding action in the target app:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/save_expense_fab, (236, 205), click, NULL):Click to save the expense and attempt to add it to the list.
~~~

This action corresponds to clicking the save button (represented by a floating action button) in the target app, which is functionally similar to clicking the "Add" action menu item in the source app. Both actions attempt to save the entered expense information.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d.click(236, 205)
···

This code uses the coordinates (236, 205) to click on the save expense button. This is the optimal choice as you mentioned that using coordinates is preferred when they are precise. The action will attempt to save the expense and add it to the list.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated several steps of the source test case to the target application. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next step:

1. We've clicked on the add expense button (step 2 in the source test case).
2. We've interacted with the date picker (steps 3-6 in the source test case).
3. We've entered the price "69.99" (step 7 in the source test case).
4. We've attempted to save the expense (similar to step 8 in the source test case).

The next step in the source test case (step 9) is to verify that an error message is displayed for the empty category field. However, in the target application, we don't see a specific category field mentioned in the current page's intent description. Instead, we have a description field.

Given this difference, we should check if there's an error message displayed for any empty required field. The most likely candidate would be the description field, as it's the main input field apart from the amount.

Let's proceed with checking for an error message:

~~~
ASSERT (TextInputLayout, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/description_inputlayout, (30, 90), matches, "Field can't be empty."):Verify that an error message "Field can't be empty." is displayed for the description field.
~~~

This assertion attempts to check if the error message is displayed on the description input layout. If this assertion fails, it might mean that either the error message is displayed differently or that the target application handles empty fields differently from the source application.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the assertion:

···
assert d(resourceId="com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/description_inputlayout").child(className="android.widget.TextView").get_text() == "Field can't be empty."
···

This code checks if the error message "Field can't be empty." is displayed in the TextInputLayout with the given resource ID. It uses the resourceId to locate the element and then checks its child TextView for the error message.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we are at step 9 of the source test case. The test has attempted to add an expense without filling in all required fields, resulting in an error message. Let's proceed with the next steps of the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/amount_edittext, (30, 170), input, ""):Clear the amount field.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/description_edittext, (30, 101), input, "Shoes"):Enter "Shoes" in the description field.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/save_expense_fab, (236, 205), click, NULL):Click to save the expense and attempt to add it to the list.
ASSERT (TextInputLayout, com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/amount_inputlayout, (30, 159), matches, "Field can't be empty."):Verify that an error message "Field can't be empty." is displayed for the amount field.
~~~

This response combines steps 10-13 of the source test case, adapting them to the target application's UI structure. We've cleared the amount field, entered "Shoes" in the description field (which corresponds to the title field in the source app), attempted to save the expense, and then asserted that an error message is displayed for the empty amount field.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the provided actions and assertions:

···
# Clear the amount field
d.click(30, 170)
d(resourceId="com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/amount_edittext").set_text("")

# Enter "Shoes" in the description field
d.click(30, 101)
d(resourceId="com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/description_edittext").set_text("Shoes")

# Click to save the expense and attempt to add it to the list
d.click(236, 205)

# Verify that an error message "Field can't be empty." is displayed for the amount field
assert d(resourceId="com.benoitletondor.easybudgetapp:id/amount_inputlayout").get_text() == "Field can't be empty."
···
