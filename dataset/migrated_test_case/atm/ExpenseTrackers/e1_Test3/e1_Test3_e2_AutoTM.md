### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), click, "Expenses"): Click on the "Expenses" text to navigate to the expenses page. The page remains unchanged after this action, suggesting it may be the title of the current page and not an interactive element.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), long_click, "Expenses"): Long click on the "Expenses" text to perform an action. The long click does not navigate to a new page or create new visible elements.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (260, 24), click, NULL): Click on the "More options" button to open a dropdown menu. The menu contains two options: "* ALL *" with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/title" and "Food" with the same id.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (260, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click to open more options menu. The action does not navigate to a new page or create new visible elements, suggesting the menu might be a popup or overlay not captured in the JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month_description, (16, 96), click, "Total of month expenses"): Click on the total month description. This action does not navigate to a new page or show new widgets, as the Current Page JSON and Next Page JSON are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month_description, (16, 96), long_click, "Total of month expenses"): Long click on the total month description. This action does not lead to any visible changes in the UI or navigation to a new page.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), click, "$0.00"): Click to view detailed expenses history for the month. The next page displays a list of expenses with options to navigate between months, and shows individual expense items with their types, amounts, and dates.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), long_click, "$0.00"): Long click on the total month expenses button to view the expenses history. The next page shows a list of expenses for the month of August with options to navigate between months and a scrollable list of individual expense items.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab, (248, 568), click, NULL): Click to open the expense creation page. The new page contains input fields for expense value (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value), description (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description), date picker (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/date_picker), expense type spinner (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_type), and a save button (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense).

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with expanding a menu to reveal expense options, but the target app's current page already shows an "Add Expense" button (represented by the ImageButton with id 'fab'). This suggests that the first two steps of the source test case can be combined into one action in the target app.

Let's proceed with the first step of the migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab, (248, 568), click, NULL): Click to open the expense creation page
~~~

This action corresponds to steps 1 and 2 of the source test case, as it directly opens the expense creation page without needing to expand a menu first. The next step would be to enter the expense details on the new page that opens after this action.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(248, 568)
···

This code uses the coordinate-based click method, which is the preferred approach as per the requirements. It clicks on the specified coordinates (248, 568) to open the expense creation page.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), click, NULL): Click to navigate back to the main Expenses page, which displays the total month expenses ($0.00) and includes a "More options" button in the top right corner.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), long_click, NULL): Long press on the "Navigate up" button to return to the main expenses page, which displays the total month expenses and a button to add new expenses.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), click, "Expenses"): Click on the "Expenses" text to navigate to the expenses input page. The page after clicking contains input fields for expense value (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value), description (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description), date picker (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/date_picker), expense type spinner (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_type), and a save button (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense).
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (72, 38), long_click, "Expenses"): Long click on the "Expenses" title. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the current and next page JSONs are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (16, 96), click, NULL): Click on the Money icon to focus on the expense value input field. The page remains the same, but the focus is now on the EditText with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value".

ACTION (android.widget.EditText, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description, (65, 158), long_click, "Add a description"): Long click on the expense description field to open additional options or context menu for text editing.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/date_picker, (57, 229), click, "08-27-2024"): Click to open date picker dialog to select a date for the expense. The dialog is not visible in the current JSON, suggesting it may be a system dialog or a custom view not captured in the provided layout.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/date_picker, (57, 229), long_click, "08-27-2024"): Long click on the date picker to potentially open a date selection dialog or provide additional options for date input. The action does not navigate to a new page or create new visible elements.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/date_picker, (57, 229), longClick, "08-27-2024"): Long click to open the date picker dialog. The dialog displays a calendar view for date selection with options to choose year, month, and day. It includes "CANCEL" and "OK" buttons with ids "android:id/button2" and "android:id/button1" respectively.
ACTION (android.widget.Spinner, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_type, (16, 283), click, "Food"): Click to open the expense type dropdown list. The new page shows a ListView with various expense categories such as Food, Education, Recreation, Dwelling, Payments, Clothes, Transportation, and Others.
ACTION (android.widget.Spinner, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_type, (16, 283), long_click, "Food"): Long click on the expense type spinner to potentially open a context menu or perform a specific action related to the expense type selection. However, no new page or dialog appears after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (31, 298), click, "Food"): Click to open expense type dropdown list. The next page shows a ListView with different expense categories such as Food, Education, Recreation, etc., each with id "android:id/text1".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (31, 298), long_click, "Food"): Long click on the expense type dropdown to open a menu for selecting different expense categories. After the action, the expense type changes from "Food" to "Payments".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense, (16, 335), longClick, "SAVE"): Long press the SAVE button to attempt saving the expense. A toast message "Ops, type a value!" appears, indicating that a value needs to be entered before saving.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to click on the expand menu button, which has already been executed successfully in the target app. Now, we need to proceed with entering the expense details. Let's move to the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value, (61, 96), click, "0.00"): Click to focus on the expense value input field
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value, (61, 96), input, "45"): Enter "45" as the amount for the new expense
~~~

This action corresponds to step 4 in the source test case, where we input the expense amount. We're combining the click action to focus on the input field and then inputting the value. Note that we've skipped step 3 (entering the description) for now, as the current page's intentions show the amount field first. We'll handle the description in the next step.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given actions:

···
d.click(61, 96)
d(resourceId="luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value").set_text("45")
···

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the expense value input field using the provided coordinates.
2. Sets the text of the expense value input field to "45" using the resource ID, which is the preferred method for text input when the widget ID is available.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), click, NULL): Click to navigate up and return to the main expenses list. The next page shows the total monthly expenses with a TextView "Total of month expenses" (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month_description) and a Button displaying "$0.00" (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month).
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), long_click, NULL): Long press on the "Navigate up" button to return to the main Expenses page, which displays total monthly expenses with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month" and a "More options" button.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll continue the test case migration. Let's proceed with the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description, (65, 158), click, "Add a description"): Click to focus on the description input field
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description, (65, 158), input, "Entertainment"): Enter "Entertainment" as the description for the new expense
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already completed steps 1 and 2 of the source test case by clicking the FAB to open the expense creation page and entering the expense amount.
2. The next step in the source test case is to enter the description "Entertainment".
3. In the target app, we need to first click on the description field to focus it, then input the text.
4. This corresponds to step 3 in the source test case: "ACTION (EditText, R.id.description_edittext, (), input, "Entertainment"): Enter "Entertainment" as the description for the new expense."

The migration is progressing as expected, matching the functionality of the source test case while adapting to the specific UI elements and actions available in the target app.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the given actions:

···
d.click(65, 158)
d(resourceId="luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description").set_text("Entertainment")
···

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll continue with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/date_picker, (57, 229), click, "08-27-2024"): Click to open the date picker dialog to change the expense date
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already completed steps 1-4 of the source test case (opening the expense creation screen, entering the amount, and entering the description).
2. The next step in the source test case is to click on the date button to open the date picker.
3. In the current page's intent description, we have a matching action for this step: "ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/date_picker, (57, 229), click, "08-27-2024"): Click to open the date picker dialog to change the expense date."
4. This action aligns with step 5 of the source test case, so we'll use it for the next step in our migration.

This action should open the date picker dialog, allowing us to proceed with selecting a date in the next step.
Based on the provided action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to click on the date picker button:

···
d.click(57, 229)
···

This code uses the coordinates (57, 229) to perform a click action, which should open the date picker dialog to change the expense date. Using coordinates is the preferred method as specified in the requirements, and it's the most precise way to interact with the UI element in this case.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at step 5 of the source test case, which involves selecting a date for the expense. The date picker dialog has been opened, and we need to select the appropriate date. Let's proceed with the next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (228, 524), click, "OK"): Click to confirm the selected date (08-27-2024) for the expense entry.
~~~

This action will confirm the date selection and return to the expense creation screen. The selected date (08-27-2024) matches the date shown in the previous step, so we don't need to change it. Clicking "OK" will complete this step of the test case.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the given action:

···
d(resourceId="android:id/button1").click()
···

This code uses the resourceId to click the "OK" button, which is a more reliable method than using coordinates. The resourceId "android:id/button1" is a standard Android identifier for positive buttons in dialogs, so it's likely to be unique and stable across different device sizes and Android versions.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), click, NULL): Click to navigate up from the Expenses detail page to the main Expenses page, which shows the total month expenses of $180.00 and has a "More options" button at the top-right corner.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), long_click, NULL): Long press on the "Navigate up" button to return to the previous screen, which appears to be the main expenses list view showing the total month expenses of $180.00.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (72, 38), click, "Expenses"): Click on the "Expenses" title. This action does not navigate to a new page or reveal new widgets, as the page content remains the same after the interaction.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, "", (72, 38), longClick, "Expenses"): Long click on the "Expenses" title. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes in the UI based on the provided JSON data.

ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/date_picker, (57, 229), long_click, "08-27-2024"): Long click on the date button to potentially open a date picker dialog or activate a date selection feature. However, the next page JSON shows no changes, suggesting this action may not have produced a visible result in this case.
ACTION (android.widget.Spinner, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_type, (16, 283), click, NULL): Click to open the expense type dropdown menu. The next page shows a list of expense categories including Food, Education, Recreation, Dwelling, Payments, Clothes, Transportation, and Others.
ACTION (android.widget.Spinner, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_type, (16, 283), longClick, "Food"): Long click on the expense type spinner to potentially open an extended menu or options for expense type selection. No new page or dialog appears, suggesting the long click may not have a specific action associated with it in this context.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (31, 298), click, "Food"): Click to open a dropdown list of expense categories. The next page shows a ListView with options like Food, Education, Recreation, Dwelling, Payments, Clothes, Transportation, and Others.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/text1, (31, 298), long_click, "Food"): Long click on the expense type to open a selection menu. The expense type changed from "Food" to "Clothes" after the interaction.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense, (16, 335), click, "SAVE"): Click the "SAVE" button to save the expense. The app returns to the main expenses page, which displays the total monthly expenses ($225.00) and has a floating action button with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab" for adding new expenses.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense, (16, 335), longClick, "SAVE"): Long click on the "SAVE" button to save the expense. This action navigates to the main expenses page, which displays the total monthly expenses (luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month) and a floating action button (luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab) for adding new expenses.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I can see that we have successfully completed several steps of the test case migration. Let's proceed with the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense, (16, 335), click, "SAVE"): Click the "SAVE" button to save the newly created expense.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 7 in the source test case: "Click on the save expense button to save the newly created expense." We're using the "SAVE" button in the target app to accomplish the same function as the FloatingActionButton in the source app.

After this action, we should be back on the main expenses page where we can verify if the expense was added correctly.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

```
d.click(16, 335)
```

This code uses the coordinates (16, 335) to click on the "SAVE" button. As per the requirements, using coordinates is the preferred method when they are precise, which they appear to be in this case. This action will click the "SAVE" button to save the newly created expense.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), click, "Expenses"): Click on the "Expenses" title. No change observed in the next page, suggesting this action may not have any effect or the element might not be actually clickable.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), longClick, "Expenses"): Long click on "Expenses" title. This action doesn't navigate to a new page, but may trigger a context menu or additional options related to the Expenses view. The total month expenses value has changed from $315.00 to $360.00, suggesting a possible update or recalculation of expenses.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (260, 24), click, NULL): Click to open options menu. A popup menu appears with two options: "* ALL *" and "Food".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (260, 24), long_click, NULL): Long click on the "More options" button to open additional settings or actions. The action does not navigate to a new page, but may show a popup menu with additional options.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month_description, (16, 96), click, "Total of month expenses"): Click on the total month description. This action does not navigate to a new page, but updates the total month expenses value from $315.00 to $495.00 in the element with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month_description, (16, 96), longClick, "Total of month expenses"): Long click on the total month description. This action updates the total month expenses from $315.00 to $540.00, as shown in the "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month" element.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), click, "$315.00"): Click to view the expenses history. The next page displays a list of expenses for the month of August with a total of $585.00, and includes navigation buttons for previous and next months.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), long_click, "$315.00"): Long click on the total month expenses button to view the expenses history. This action navigates to a new page showing a list of expenses for the month of August, with options to navigate between months and view individual expense details.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab, (248, 568), click, NULL): Click to add a new expense. The page after clicking this control is the add expense page, which has input fields for expense value (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value), description (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description), date picker (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/date_picker), expense type (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_type), and a save button (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense).
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/fab, (248, 568), longClick, NULL): Long click to open the expense creation page. The new page contains input fields for expense value (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_value), description (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_description), date picker (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/date_picker), expense type spinner (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/expense_type), and a save button (id: luankevinferreira.expenses:id/save_expense).

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll analyze the current state of the test migration and determine the next step:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month, (16, 126), matches, "$360.00"): Verify that the total month expenses have been updated to include the newly added expense of $45.00
~~~

Explanation:
1. We have successfully migrated steps 1-7 of the source test case to the target application. The actions performed include opening the expense creation page, entering the amount and description, selecting a date, and saving the expense.

2. The next step in the source test case is to verify that the expense has been added correctly. In the source app, this was done by checking a specific grid cell. However, in the target app, we don't have information about a similar grid cell.

3. Instead, we can verify the addition of the expense by checking if the total month expenses have been updated. From the current page's intent description, we know that the total month expenses are displayed in an element with id "luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month".

4. The original total was $315.00, and we added a new expense of $45.00. Therefore, we expect the new total to be $360.00.

5. This assertion serves the same purpose as the original test case's final step - verifying that the new expense has been successfully added and reflected in the app's calculations.

This completes the migration of all steps from the source test case to the target application. However, we should wait for confirmation of this assertion before concluding the migration process.
Based on the provided input, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to verify the total month expenses:

···
assert d(resourceId="luankevinferreira.expenses:id/total_month").get_text() == "$360.00"
···

This code uses the resourceId to locate the TextView element and checks if its text matches the expected value of "$360.00". This approach is preferred when the resourceId is unique and available, as it's more reliable than using coordinates for assertions.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated most of the steps from the source test case to the target application. Let's review the progress and determine the next step:

1. We've clicked on the add expense button (FAB).
2. We've entered the expense amount of 45.
3. We've entered the description "Entertainment".
4. We've clicked on the date picker and confirmed a date.
5. We've saved the expense.
6. We've verified that the total month expenses have been updated.

The main steps from the source test case have been completed. However, we need to verify that the specific expense we added is visible in the list. In the source test case, this was done by checking for the text "-45" in a grid cell. In our target app, we need to find a similar way to verify the newly added expense.

Let's try to find and verify the newly added expense in the list:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (), matches, "Entertainment"): Verify that the newly added expense description "Entertainment" is visible in the expense list.
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (), matches, "45.00"): Verify that the newly added expense amount "45.00" is visible in the expense list.
DONE
~~~

This assertion attempts to verify that both the description "Entertainment" and the amount "45.00" are visible in the expense list. If these assertions pass, we can consider the test case migration complete. The DONE statement indicates that we believe all steps of the source test case have been successfully migrated to the target app.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given assertions:

···
assert d(text="Entertainment").exists(), "Entertainment expense description not found"
assert d(text="45.00").exists(), "Expense amount 45.00 not found"
···

This code uses the text attribute to verify the existence of both the expense description "Entertainment" and the amount "45.00" in the expense list. The assertions will raise an exception if either of these elements is not found, providing a clear indication of what failed.
