#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with editing an existing expense, but the current page of the target app seems to be the main page or dashboard. Let's start by finding a way to access the list of expenses or transactions.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/btn_add_expense, (160, 589), click, "ADD EXPENSE"): Click to open the "Add expense" page to access the expense editing functionality.
~~~

This action will open the expense adding page, which is the closest match to the editing functionality we need for the first step of the source test case. From there, we can look for ways to edit existing expenses or navigate to a list of expenses.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d.click(160, 589)
···

This code uses the coordinates (160, 589) to click on the "ADD EXPENSE" button, which opens the "Add expense" page to access the expense editing functionality. Using coordinates is the preferred method as specified in the requirements.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case is about editing an existing expense, but the current page in the target app is for adding a new expense. Let's proceed with the next logical step to match the functionality as closely as possible.

~~~
ACTION (TextInputLayout, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/til_price, (16, 153), click, "Price"):Click on the price input field to enter the expense amount
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_price, (16, 164), input, "40.00"):Enter the new amount "40.00" in the price input field
~~~

Explanation:
1. We're adapting the test case to the current context. Instead of editing an existing expense, we're adding a new one with the amount from the source test case.
2. We first click on the price input field to focus it.
3. Then we input the value "40.00" into the price field, which corresponds to step 3 in the source test case.
4. We're combining two actions (focusing and inputting) to achieve the desired result, as the target app might require these separate steps.

This approach allows us to continue with the test case migration, adapting to the differences between the source and target apps while maintaining the core functionality being tested.
Based on the provided actions, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(16, 153)
d(resourceId="com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_price").set_text("40.00")
···

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the price input field using the provided coordinates.
2. Sets the text "40.00" in the price input field using the resource ID of the EditText widget.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we can proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the appropriate action:

1. We have already opened the "Add expense" page.
2. We have entered the amount "40.00" in the price input field.

The next logical step in the source test case is to save the expense. However, in the target app, we need to fill in the required fields before we can save the expense. The current page's intentions indicate that the Category field is mandatory and cannot be left empty.

Therefore, let's proceed with filling in the Category field:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_category, (16, 278), input, "Groceries"):Enter a category name for the expense
~~~

This action will input "Groceries" as the category for the expense. After this, we should be able to save the expense.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d(resourceId="com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_category").set_text("Groceries")
```

This code uses the resourceId to identify the EditText field and sets its text to "Groceries". This method is preferred when we have a unique and non-empty ID for the widget, as it's more reliable than using coordinates for text input.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've successfully opened the "Add expense" page.
2. We've entered the amount "40.00" in the price input field.
3. We've entered "Groceries" as the category for the expense.

The next logical step in our source test case is to save the expense. In the target app, we have an action that seems to correspond to this:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/action_done, (272, 28), click, NULL): Click to add the expense. The page after clicking this control is the Records page, which displays a summary of transactions and includes a new expense entry with details "Groceries" and "- 40 NON".
~~~

This action appears to be the equivalent of the "save" button in the source test case. Let's proceed with this action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/action_done, (272, 28), click, NULL): Click to add the expense and save the changes.
~~~

This action should save the expense and return us to the Records page. After this, we should verify that the expense has been added correctly, which corresponds to the assertion step in our source test case.
Based on the provided actions, I'll convert them into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the implementation:

···
# Click to add the expense
d.click(272, 28)

# Click again to add another expense and save changes
d.click(272, 28)
···

I've used the coordinates (272, 28) for both actions as they are precise and available. This approach is preferred as per the requirements. The actions are implemented as simple clicks using the device's click method with the given coordinates.

Note that I've used the device variable name 'd' as specified in the "Device Variable Name" section. Both actions are identical, so the same code is repeated. This code will perform the required actions of adding expenses and saving changes on the Money Tracker app.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll analyze the current state of the test migration and determine the next step.

The source test case is about editing an existing expense, while the executed actions so far have been about adding a new expense. However, the core functionality of modifying an expense amount is similar. Let's proceed with verifying the newly added expense, which corresponds to step 5 in the source test case.

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/tv_price, (208, 281), matches, "- 40"):Verify that the expense amount is displayed as "- 40" after adding the new expense.
~~~

This assertion checks if the newly added expense is correctly displayed with the amount we just entered. The slight difference in the displayed amount ("- 40" instead of "-$40.00") is due to the different currency and formatting used in the target app.

If this assertion passes, we can consider the test case migration complete, as we've successfully added an expense with the desired amount and verified its presence. If you need any further actions or have any additional information, please let me know.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to verify the expense amount:

···
assert d(resourceId="com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/tv_price", className="android.widget.TextView").get_text() == "- 40"
···

This code checks if the TextView with the specified resource ID contains the text "- 40", which represents the expense amount. The assertion will pass if the text matches exactly, and fail otherwise.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated the test case for editing an expense. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've added a new expense of 40.00 with the category "Groceries".
2. The expense has been successfully added and is visible on the Records page.
3. We've verified that the expense amount is displayed as "- 40".

The next step in the source test case would be to edit this expense. However, in the target app, we need to first access the edit functionality for the newly added expense. Here's what we should do next:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.FrameLayout, , (0, 273), long_click, NULL): Long click on the expense record to open options menu for editing the expense.
~~~

This action should open a context menu or dialog with options to edit or delete the expense record. We're using the long click action as it's more likely to bring up additional options compared to a regular click.
Based on the provided action and the requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.long_click(0, 273, 1)
···

This code performs a long click at the coordinates (0, 273) for 1 second, which should open the options menu for editing the expense as described in the action. The long click duration of 1 second is included as per the common operations guidelines.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Here's my analysis and recommendation:

1. We've successfully added a new expense of $40.00 for "Groceries", which aligns with the editing functionality in the source test case.
2. We've verified that the expense amount is displayed correctly after adding.
3. The next step in the source test case is to edit an existing expense.
4. We've just performed a long click on the expense record, which should open options for editing.

Given this context, the next logical step would be to select the edit option from the menu that appears after the long click. Here's the proposed next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (0, 0), click, "Edit"): Click on the "Edit" option in the context menu to open the expense editing page.
~~~

This action attempts to select the "Edit" option from the context menu that appeared after the long click. The coordinates are set to (0, 0) as we don't have specific information about the position of this menu item. The actual coordinates may need to be adjusted based on the app's UI.

If this action is successful, it should open the expense editing page, allowing us to proceed with modifying the expense amount as per the source test case.
Based on the provided action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d(text="Edit").click()
···

This code uses the text attribute to locate and click on the "Edit" option. Since the coordinates provided are (0, 0), which are not precise or useful, and no specific ID is given, using the text attribute is the most reliable method in this case.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are in the process of migrating a test case for editing an existing expense. We have successfully added a new expense and verified its presence. Now, we are attempting to edit this expense. However, the last action to click on the "Edit" option failed. Let's try an alternative approach to edit the expense.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.FrameLayout, , (0, 273), click, NULL): Click on the expense record to open the expense editing page.
~~~

This action attempts to open the expense editing page by directly clicking on the expense record instead of using the context menu. This is a common alternative in many expense tracking apps where clicking on an expense item opens its editing page.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d.click(0, 273)
···

This code uses the device variable 'd' as specified, and clicks on the coordinates (0, 273) to open the expense editing page. Since the coordinates are provided and precise, we use them directly for the click action, which is the optimal choice as per the requirements.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully added a new expense and are now attempting to edit it. The long-click action to open the edit options menu failed, so we tried clicking on the expense record directly to open the editing page. Let's continue with the editing process based on the current state:

~~~
ACTION (TextInputLayout, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/til_price, (16, 153), click, "Price"): Click on the price input field to edit the expense amount.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_price, (16, 164), input, "40.00"): Enter the new amount "40.00" in the price input field.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/action_done, (272, 28), click, NULL): Click to save the edited expense.
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/tv_price, (208, 281), matches, "- 40"): Verify that the expense amount is displayed as "- 40" after editing the expense.
DONE
~~~

This sequence of actions corresponds to steps 3 and 4 in the source test case, where we edit the expense amount and save the changes. The assertion at the end verifies that the change has been applied correctly, which aligns with step 5 of the source test case.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

```
d.click(16, 153)
d(resourceId="com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/et_price").set_text("40.00")
d.click(272, 28)
assert d(resourceId="com.blogspot.e_kanivets.moneytracker:id/tv_price").get_text() == "- 40"
```

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the price input field using coordinates.
2. Enters "40.00" into the price input field using the resource ID.
3. Clicks the save button using coordinates.
4. Verifies that the expense amount is displayed as "- 40" after editing.
````
### Success
