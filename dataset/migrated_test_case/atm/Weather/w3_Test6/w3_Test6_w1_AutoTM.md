#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with accessing the "Extras" menu item in the toolbar. Let's try to find a similar action in the target application.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (280, 28), click, NULL): Click to open options menu. The menu displays items including "Weather Map", "Graphs", "Detect Location", "Settings", and "About".
~~~

This action seems to be the closest match to the first step of the source test case. It opens the options menu, which should contain the "Settings" option we need for the next step. Let's proceed with this action and see what options become available in the next step.
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(280, 28)
···

This code uses the coordinate-based click method as specified in the requirements. It clicks on the ImageView at the coordinates (280, 28) to open the options menu.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (120, 28), click, NULL): Click on the "Weather Map" option in the menu. This action does not navigate to a new page, as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON, indicating that the menu remains open after the click.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/title, (136, 41), click, "Weather Map"): Click on "Weather Map" to open the weather map page. The new page displays a WebView with zoom controls and a bottom bar with options for Rain, Wind, and Temperature map layers.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/title, (136, 137), click, "Detect Location"): Click to detect the current location. A dialog appears with a message "Getting your location ..." and a "CANCEL" button with id "android:id/button2".

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/title, (136, 233), click, "About"): Click on the "About" option to open the About dialog, which displays information about the app including its version, developers, data sources, and licensing details.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with accessing the settings, and we have successfully opened the options menu in the target app. The next logical step would be to navigate to the Settings page. Let's proceed with this action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/title, (136, 185), click, "Settings"): Click on "Settings" to navigate to the Settings page
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 in the source test case, where the user clicks on the "Settings" option in the submenu. In the target app, we're directly clicking on the "Settings" option from the opened menu. This slight difference in navigation is expected as the apps may have different menu structures, but the end result (accessing the Settings page) is the same.
Based on the provided information and guidelines, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(136, 185)
···

This code uses the coordinates (136, 185) to perform a click action, which should navigate to the Settings page by clicking on the "Settings" option. This approach is preferred as it uses precise coordinates, which is the optimal choice according to the given requirements.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the Settings page of the target application. Let's proceed with the next step of the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, android:id/list, (0, 80), click, NULL): Click on the list view to interact with the settings options
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (16, 335), click, "Speed units"): Click to open the Speed units selection dialog
~~~

Explanation:
1. In the source test case, the third step is to click on the fourth item in the settings list. In the target app, we don't have information about the exact position of the speed units setting, but we know it exists.
2. We first interact with the ListView to ensure we can access all settings options.
3. Then, we specifically click on the "Speed units" option, which corresponds to clicking on a specific setting in the source test case.
4. This action should open a dialog with speed unit options, similar to the dialog that appears in the source test case.

This approach maintains the functional similarity of accessing a specific setting and opening a selection dialog, even though the exact setting (temperature vs. speed) might be different between the source and target apps.
Based on the provided actions, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(0, 80)
d(text="Speed units").click()
···

This code first clicks on the list view at coordinates (0, 80) to interact with the settings options. Then, it clicks on the "Speed units" option using the text attribute, which is more reliable than using coordinates in this case since the text is confirmed.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (40, 175), click, "Speed units"): Click on the title "Speed units" of the dialog. This action does not change the page, as the dialog remains open with the same options for selecting speed units.
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 211), click, "Meters per second (m/s)"): Click to select Meters per second (m/s) as the speed unit. The selection dialog remains open with the chosen option now checked.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (215, 455), click, "CANCEL"): Click the CANCEL button to dismiss the Speed units selection dialog without making changes. The page returns to the Settings screen with the Speed units option unchanged, showing "Meters per second (m/s)" as the current selection.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the step where we need to select a specific option in the "Speed units" dialog. This corresponds to step 4 in the source test case. Let's proceed with the migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 211), click, "Meters per second (m/s)"): Click to select Meters per second (m/s) as the speed unit
ASSERT (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 211), "Meters per second (m/s)"): Verify that "Meters per second (m/s)" is selected as the speed unit
~~~

Explanation:
1. We click on the "Meters per second (m/s)" option in the dialog, which corresponds to selecting the fourth option in the source test case.
2. We add an assertion to verify that the correct option has been selected.

This action completes the migration of the source test case. However, we should wait for the result of this action before concluding the migration process. If this action is successful, we can then respond with DONE in the next interaction.
Based on the provided actions, I'll convert them into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the implementation:

···
# Click to select Meters per second (m/s) as the speed unit
d.click(16, 211)

# Verify that "Meters per second (m/s)" is selected as the speed unit
assert d(resourceId="android:id/text1", text="Meters per second (m/s)").exists()
···

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (16, 211) to select "Meters per second (m/s)" as the speed unit. Then, it verifies that the selected option exists and has the correct text.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (40, 175), click, "Speed units"): Click on the title "Speed units" of the dialog. This action does not change the page, as the dialog remains open with the same options for selecting speed units.
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 211), click, "Meters per second (m/s)"): Click to select Meters per second (m/s) as the speed unit. The selection dialog remains open with the chosen option now checked.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (215, 455), click, "CANCEL"): Click the CANCEL button to dismiss the Speed units selection dialog without making changes. The page returns to the Settings screen with the Speed units option unchanged, showing "Meters per second (m/s)" as the current selection.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated the test case up to the point of selecting a specific option in the settings. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've navigated to the Settings page.
2. We've selected the "Speed units" option.
3. We've chosen "Meters per second (m/s)" in the dialog.

The next step in the source test case was to click on the fourth option in the dialog. However, in our target app, we've already selected an option ("Meters per second (m/s)"). At this point, we need to confirm the selection to complete this step of the test case.

Given the current page's intent description, we have an option to either confirm or cancel the selection. Since we want to complete the action of changing the setting, we should confirm the selection rather than canceling it.

Here's the next action I recommend:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (425, 455), click, NULL): Click the OK button to confirm the selection of "Meters per second (m/s)" as the speed unit and close the dialog
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/summary, (16, 359), "Meters per second (m/s)"): Verify that the speed unit setting has been updated to "Meters per second (m/s)" on the Settings page
~~~

This action will confirm the selection we've made and close the dialog, completing the migration of the fourth step in the source test case. The assertion will verify that the change has been applied correctly.
Based on the provided actions, I'll convert them into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the corresponding code:

···
d.click(425, 455)
assert d(resourceId="android:id/summary").get_text() == "Meters per second (m/s)"
···

This code does the following:

1. Clicks the OK button at the coordinates (425, 455) to confirm the selection of "Meters per second (m/s)" as the speed unit and close the dialog.
2. Verifies that the speed unit setting has been updated to "Meters per second (m/s)" on the Settings page by checking the text of the element with the resource ID "android:id/summary".
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (40, 175), click, "Speed units"): Click on the title "Speed units" of the dialog. This action does not change the page, as the dialog remains open with the same options for selecting speed units.
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 211), click, "Meters per second (m/s)"): Click to select Meters per second (m/s) as the speed unit. The selection dialog remains open with the chosen option now checked.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (215, 455), click, "CANCEL"): Click the CANCEL button to dismiss the Speed units selection dialog without making changes. The page returns to the Settings screen with the Speed units option unchanged, showing "Meters per second (m/s)" as the current selection.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated the test case for changing a setting option in the weather application. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've navigated to the Settings page through the menu.
2. We've selected the "Speed units" option from the settings list.
3. We've chosen "Meters per second (m/s)" from the dialog that appeared.
4. We've confirmed the selection and verified that it has been applied.

These actions correspond to all four steps in the source test case:

1. Clicking the "Extras" menu item (in our case, it was an options menu)
2. Selecting "Settings"
3. Clicking on a specific item in the settings list (in our case, "Speed units")
4. Selecting an option from the dialog that appears

Since we have successfully completed all steps of the source test case and verified the results, we can conclude that the test migration is complete. Therefore, I will respond with DONE:

~~~
DONE
~~~

This indicates that we have successfully migrated the entire test case from the source application to the target application, matching all the required steps and verifying the results.
I understand that you want me to convert Android test semantic descriptions into UIAutomator2 code in Python. However, you haven't provided any specific actions to convert in your last message. You only mentioned "DONE" under the Actions section.

Without any specific actions to convert, I cannot generate any UIAutomator2 code. If you have any specific actions you'd like me to convert, please provide them in the format you described earlier:

ACTION (element, id, coordinates, action, value):purpose

Once you provide the actions, I'll be happy to convert them into UIAutomator2 code for you, following the guidelines and requirements you've outlined.
