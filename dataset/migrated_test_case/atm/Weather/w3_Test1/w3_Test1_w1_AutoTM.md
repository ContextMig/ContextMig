#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to open the city search interface. Let's find the corresponding action in the target app.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/action_search, (232, 28), click, NULL):Click to open the search dialog for adding a new city
~~~

This action corresponds to the first step in the source test case, which is clicking on the "Add city" menu item. In the target app, we have a search action that opens a search dialog, which is functionally similar to opening a city search interface.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code for the given action:

```
d.click(232, 28)
```

This code uses the coordinate-based approach as requested, clicking on the specified location (232, 28) to open the search dialog for adding a new city.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/alertTitle, (48, 275), click, "Search for city"): Click on the title of the search dialog. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new elements, as the dialog remains open with the same components: an EditText for input, and "CANCEL" and "OK" buttons.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, , (56, 303), click, NULL): Click on the search input field to enter a city name for weather search. The dialog remains open with an empty input field, "CANCEL" button (id: android:id/button2), and "OK" button (id: android:id/button1).
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (143, 355), click, "CANCEL"): Click to cancel the city search operation and return to the main weather display page for Atlanta, US. The page after clicking shows the current weather information with temperature, description, wind, pressure, humidity, sunrise, and sunset details.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (220, 355), click, "OK"): Click the OK button to confirm the city search. After clicking, the app returns to the main weather page with updated information for the searched city, including temperature, weather description, wind, pressure, humidity, and sunrise/sunset times.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, , (56, 303), input, "Mumbai"):Enter "Mumbai" into the search input field to search for the city
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already executed the first step of opening the search dialog, which corresponds to step 1 in the source test case.
2. The next logical step is to enter the city name "Mumbai" into the search field, which aligns with step 2 of the source test case.
3. The current page's intent description provides an EditText field for input, which matches our need for entering the city name.
4. Although the EditText doesn't have a specific id in the target app, its coordinates and purpose align with what we need for this step.

This action should allow us to enter "Mumbai" into the search field, preparing for the next step of confirming the search.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(56, 303)
d(className="android.widget.EditText").set_text("Mumbai")
···

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (56, 303) to focus on the EditText field, and then uses the set_text method to enter "Mumbai" into the input field. Since no specific resourceId was provided, we use the className to identify the EditText widget.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/alertTitle, (48, 152), click, "Search for city"): Click on the title of the search dialog. This action does not navigate to a new page or cause any visible changes in the UI.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, , (56, 180), click, "Mumbai"): Click on the EditText field to select "Mumbai" as the city to search for. No new page or widgets appear after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (143, 232), click, "CANCEL"): Click to cancel the city search operation. The page after clicking this button returns to the main weather display for Atlanta, US, which includes temperature, weather conditions, and other meteorological data.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (220, 232), click, "OK"): Click the OK button to confirm the search for the city "Mumbai". After clicking, the app navigates to the weather forecast page for Mumbai, displaying current weather conditions, temperature, wind speed, pressure, humidity, and sunrise/sunset times.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (220, 232), click, NULL):Click the OK button to confirm the search for Mumbai and add it to the city list
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in the source test case, where the search button is clicked to initiate the search for Mumbai. In the target app, this functionality is achieved by clicking the OK button in the search dialog.

The next step would typically involve verifying that Mumbai has been added to the city list. However, we don't have information about the current page after this action. We'll need to wait for the result of this action and the description of the next page to determine how to proceed with the verification step.
Based on the provided action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(220, 232)
···

This code uses the coordinates (220, 232) to click the OK button, which is the most precise method as per the requirements. The coordinates are directly used with the device variable 'd' to perform the click action.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully completed the first three steps of the source test case. Let's proceed with the next step in the migration process.

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), matches, "Mumbai, IN"):Verify that the city name displayed matches "Mumbai, IN"
~~~

This assertion checks if the newly added city (Mumbai) is now displayed on the main weather page. This corresponds to step 5 in the source test case, where we verify the presence of the added city. The slight difference in the city name ("Mumbai, IN" instead of just "Mumbai") is likely due to the target app including the country code, which is an acceptable variation.

If this assertion passes, it confirms that we have successfully migrated the test case for adding a new city. However, we should wait for the result of this assertion before proceeding further or concluding the migration process.
Based on the provided action and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to verify that the city name displayed matches "Mumbai, IN":

···
assert d(text="Mumbai, IN").exists()
···

This code uses the text attribute to check for the existence of the specified text "Mumbai, IN" on the screen. It's a more reliable method than using coordinates in this case, as the text content is confirmed and unique.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully completed the migration of the test case for adding a new city (Mumbai) to the weather app. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've clicked on the search action to open the search dialog.
2. We've entered "Mumbai" into the search input field.
3. We've confirmed the search by clicking the OK button.
4. We've verified that the city name displayed matches "Mumbai, IN".

These steps correspond closely to the steps in the source test case, with some minor differences in the UI elements and their identifiers, which is expected when migrating between different apps.

Given that we have successfully performed all the necessary actions and made the required assertion, it seems that we have completed the test case migration. Therefore, I believe we can conclude this migration process.

Here's the response in the required format:

~~~
DONE
~~~

This indicates that we have successfully matched and migrated all steps of the source test case to the target app. If you have any further tasks or if you'd like me to verify any specific aspects of the migration, please let me know.
Thank you for providing the device variable name and the instructions. I understand that you want me to convert Android test semantic descriptions into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Since you haven't provided any specific actions to convert, I'll wait for your input. When you provide the actions, I'll convert them into UIAutomator2 code using the device variable name 'd' and following the guidelines you've specified. Please provide the actions you'd like me to convert, and I'll be ready to assist you.
