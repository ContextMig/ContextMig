#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the beginning of the test case migration. The first two steps of the source test case have been executed successfully in the target app. Now, let's proceed with the next step of the migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (16, 335), click, NULL):Click to open the Speed units selection dialog
~~~

Explanation:
1. In the source test case, step 3 is "Click on the second item in the settings list (index 1)".
2. From the current page's intent description, we can see that "Speed units" is one of the options in the settings list.
3. The intention "ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (16, 335), click, "Speed units"): Click to open the Speed units selection dialog" matches our need for this step.
4. This action will open the dialog for selecting speed units, which aligns with the next step in the source test case where we need to select a specific speed unit.

This action will prepare us for the next step of selecting a specific speed unit, which corresponds to step 4 in the source test case.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d.click(16, 335)
···

This code uses the coordinates (16, 335) to click on the TextView element, which opens the Speed units selection dialog. Since coordinates are provided and are precise, they are used as the preferred method for interaction.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (40, 175), click, "Speed units"): Click on the title "Speed units" of the dialog. This action does not change the page, as the dialog remains open with the same options for selecting speed units.
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 211), click, "Meters per second (m/s)"): Click to select Meters per second (m/s) as the speed unit. The selection dialog remains open with the chosen option now checked.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (215, 455), click, "CANCEL"): Click the CANCEL button to dismiss the Speed units selection dialog without making changes. The page returns to the Settings screen with the Speed units option unchanged, showing "Meters per second (m/s)" as the current selection.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at step 4 of the source test case, where we need to select a wind speed unit. The current page shows a dialog for selecting speed units. Let's proceed with the migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 211), click, "Meters per second (m/s)"):Select "Meters per second (m/s)" as the speed unit
~~~

Explanation:
1. In the source test case, step 4 involves selecting the second option in the wind speed unit dialog (likely km/h).
2. In the target app, we have an option to select "Meters per second (m/s)" which is different from the source app's km/h, but it's still a valid speed unit.
3. We're selecting this option to change the speed unit, which aligns with the purpose of the source test case step.
4. After this action, we should be ready to return to the main screen and verify the changes, which would correspond to steps 5 and 6 in the source test case.

Note that we're adapting to the available options in the target app while maintaining the overall purpose of changing the speed unit. The exact unit (m/s instead of km/h) is different, but the functionality being tested (changing speed units) remains the same.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

```
d(resourceId="android:id/text1", text="Meters per second (m/s)").click()
```

This code will click on the CheckedTextView element with the text "Meters per second (m/s)" to select it as the speed unit. I've used the resourceId and text attributes to identify the element, as they are more reliable than coordinates in this case.

~~~

This action selects the "Kilometers per hour (kph)" option in the Speed units selection dialog, which corresponds to step 4 in the source test case where the second option (likely km/h) is selected. The coordinates (16, 259) are estimated based on the position of the "Meters per second (m/s)" option in the previous action, assuming the "Kilometers per hour (kph)" option is the next item in the list.
Based on the given action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d(resourceId="android:id/text1", text="Kilometers per hour (kph)").click()
···

This code will click on the CheckedTextView element with the text "Kilometers per hour (kph)" to select it as the speed unit. I've used the resourceId and text attributes to locate the element, as they provide a more reliable way to find the specific item compared to using coordinates in this case.

Based on the provided information, it appears we are in the process of migrating the test case for changing wind speed units. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next step:

1. We have successfully navigated to the Settings page.
2. We have opened the Speed units selection dialog.
3. We attempted to select "Kilometers per hour (kph)" as the speed unit, but this action failed.

Given that the last action failed, we should try an alternative approach to select the desired speed unit. Let's attempt to select the "Miles per hour (mph)" option instead, as this aligns with step 12 in the source test case.

Here's the next action to try:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 307), click, "Miles per hour (mph)"):Select "Miles per hour (mph)" as the speed unit
~~~

This action attempts to select the "Miles per hour (mph)" option from the Speed units selection dialog. If successful, it will set the speed unit to mph, which aligns with the goal of the source test case.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(16, 307)
···

This code uses the coordinates (16, 307) to perform a click action, which selects "Miles per hour (mph)" as the speed unit. Using coordinates is the preferred method as specified in the requirements.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (40, 247), click, "Length units"): Click on the title of the Length units dialog. This action does not navigate to a new page or change the current dialog, as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 283), click, "Millimeters (mm)"): Click to select Millimeters (mm) as the length unit. This action doesn't navigate to a new page, but may update the selected state of the CheckedTextView.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (215, 383), click, "CANCEL"): Click to cancel the length units selection and return to the Settings page. The page after clicking this button shows the Settings list with various options including "Temperature units", "Length units", "Speed units", and "Pressure units".

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we can analyze the current situation and determine the next step for the test case migration:

1. The source test case is about changing wind speed units and verifying the changes in the weather display.
2. We have already navigated to the Settings page and opened the Speed units selection dialog.
3. We have successfully selected "Meters per second (m/s)" and then "Miles per hour (mph)" as the speed unit.

The next logical step in the migration process would be to confirm the selection and return to the main screen to verify the changes. However, the current page's intent description doesn't show an option to confirm the selection. In this case, we can assume that the selection is automatically saved when an option is clicked.

Therefore, the next step should be to return to the main screen and check the weather display. Here's the proposed next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (215, 383), click, NULL):Click to close the speed units dialog and return to the Settings page
~~~

This action will close the speed units dialog and take us back to the Settings page. From there, we can navigate back to the main screen in the next step to verify the wind speed display.
Based on the given action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(215, 383)
···

This code uses the coordinates (215, 383) to click on the button, which is the optimal choice as per the requirements. This action will close the speed units dialog and return to the Settings page.

Based on the provided information, I will proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We have changed the wind speed unit to "Miles per hour (mph)" in the settings.
2. We have returned to the main screen.

The next logical step in the source test case is to verify that the wind speed is now displayed in mph. Here's the corresponding action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/todayWind, (16, 165), click, "Wind: 3.6 m/s ↙"):Click on the wind information to refresh and view the updated wind speed unit
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/todayWind, (16, 165), matches, "contains ' mph'"):Verify that the wind speed is now displayed in mph
~~~

This action and assertion correspond to steps 14 and 15 in the source test case. We're clicking on the wind information to ensure it's updated, and then asserting that the wind speed is now displayed in mph.

Note that we're using the `todayWind` TextView instead of the `wind_text_view` from the source test case, as this seems to be the corresponding element in the target app based on the provided intentions.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(16, 165)
assert 'mph' in d(resourceId="cz.martykan.forecastie:id/todayWind").get_text()
···

This code does the following:
1. Clicks on the wind information TextView at the specified coordinates (16, 165).
2. Verifies that the text of the wind information TextView now contains 'mph', indicating that the wind speed unit has been updated to miles per hour.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully migrated steps 9 through 15 of the source test case. The wind speed unit has been changed to mph, and we have verified that the change is reflected in the main weather display. 

Now, let's proceed with the next step in our test migration. We need to change the wind speed unit back to km/h (kilometers per hour) as per steps 1-7 of the source test case. Here's the next action we should take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (280, 28), click, NULL):Open options menu to access Settings
~~~

This action corresponds to step 1 of the source test case, where we click on the "Extras" menu item. In the target app, this is represented by the options menu button in the top right corner.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(280, 28)
···

This code uses the coordinates (280, 28) to click on the ImageView element, which will open the options menu to access Settings. Since the coordinates are provided and precise, this is the optimal choice for the action as per the requirements.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (120, 28), click, NULL): Click on the "Weather Map" option in the menu. This action does not navigate to a new page, as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON, indicating that the menu remains open after the click.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/title, (136, 41), click, "Weather Map"): Click on "Weather Map" to open the weather map page. The new page displays a WebView with zoom controls and a bottom bar with options for Rain, Wind, and Temperature map layers.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/title, (136, 137), click, "Detect Location"): Click to detect the current location. A dialog appears with a message "Getting your location ..." and a "CANCEL" button with id "android:id/button2".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/title, (136, 185), click, "Settings"): Click on "Settings" to navigate to the Settings page, which includes various options such as Temperature units, Length units, Speed units, and Pressure units.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/title, (136, 233), click, "About"): Click on the "About" option to open the About dialog, which displays information about the app including its version, developers, data sources, and licensing details.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I can determine that we are currently at step 10 of the source test case, which is to navigate back to the Settings page after verifying the wind speed unit change. Let's proceed with the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/title, (136, 185), click, NULL):Click on "Settings" to navigate to the Settings page
~~~

This action corresponds to step 10 in the source test case, where we need to access the Settings page again to change the wind speed unit back to km/h. The next step would be to select the speed unit option in the Settings page.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(136, 185)
···

This code uses the coordinate-based click operation as specified in the requirements. It clicks on the "Settings" TextView at the coordinates (136, 185) to navigate to the Settings page.

I understand that you want me to convert Android test semantic descriptions into UIAutomator2 code in Python, using the device variable name 'd'. However, you haven't provided any specific actions to convert in this instance. You've only given me the device variable name and the word "DONE".

If you have any specific actions you'd like me to convert, please provide them in the format you described earlier:

ACTION (element, id, coordinates, action, value):purpose

Or

ASSERT (element, id, coordinates, oracle):purpose

Once you provide these actions, I'll be happy to convert them into UIAutomator2 code for you.
