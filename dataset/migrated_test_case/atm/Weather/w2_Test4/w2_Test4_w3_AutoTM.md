#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with opening the navigation drawer, but the current page's intentions don't show a direct match for this action. However, we can see that there's a menu option that might lead us to similar functionality. Let's start with this action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.haringeymobile.ukweather:id/mi_main_submenu, (264, 28), click, NULL):Click to open the extras menu to access additional options
~~~

This action opens the extras menu, which might contain options similar to what we're looking for in the navigation drawer of the source app. We'll need to see the result of this action before proceeding further.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code for the given action:

```
d.click(264, 28)
```

This code uses the coordinates (264, 28) to click on the specified TextView element, which opens the extras menu to access additional options. The coordinate-based approach is preferred as it's more precise and reliable in this case.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (112, 28), click, NULL): Click on the "City Management" option to open the city management page. The action does not navigate to a new page, as the next page JSON is identical to the current page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.haringeymobile.ukweather:id/title, (177, 41), click, "City Management"): Click on "City Management" to open the city management page. The new page displays a list of cities with options to rename (id: com.haringeymobile.ukweather:id/city_rename_button) and remove (id: com.haringeymobile.ukweather:id/city_remove_button) each city.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.haringeymobile.ukweather:id/title, (177, 89), click, "Settings"): Click on "Settings" to open the settings page. The new page displays various setting options including temperature scale, wind speed measurement units, wind direction display, weather data reuse period, app theme, and three-hourly weather forecast display mode.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.haringeymobile.ukweather:id/title, (177, 185), click, "About"): Click on the "About" option to navigate to the About page, which displays app version, copyright information, credits, and licenses.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to open the navigation drawer. Since we've already clicked to open the extras menu, which seems to be equivalent to the navigation drawer in the target app, we can proceed to the next step.

The next step in the source test case is to click on the second item in the navigation menu, which is likely the Graphs section. However, in the current page's intent description, we don't see a direct equivalent to a Graphs section. The closest option that might contain graphs or similar functionality is the "City Management" option.

Let's proceed with selecting the "City Management" option:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.haringeymobile.ukweather:id/title, (177, 41), click, NULL):Click on "City Management" to open the city management page
~~~

This action should navigate us to the city management page, which might contain weather information or graphs for the managed cities. We'll need to see the next page's intentions to determine if this is the correct path or if we need to explore other options.
Based on the provided action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(177, 41)
···

This code uses the coordinate-based click method, which is the preferred approach as per the requirements. The action is to click on the "City Management" element, and we're using the exact coordinates (177, 41) provided in the input.

Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.view.ViewGroup, , (7, 86), click, NULL):Click on the city item "London" to view its weather details
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already navigated to the City Management page, which is similar to the Graphs section in the source test case.
2. The next logical step is to select a city to view its weather details, which aligns with the purpose of viewing weather graphs in the source test case.
3. Clicking on the city item "London" should lead us to a page where we can view weather information, potentially including graphs.

This action corresponds to step 2 in the source test case (clicking on the Graphs section), as it navigates to a page where we expect to see weather data visualizations.
Based on the provided action and requirements, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(7, 86)
···

This code uses the coordinates (7, 86) to click on the "London" city item, as specified in the action description. Using coordinates is the preferred method when they are provided and precise, which is the case here.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have navigated to the city management page and selected the city "London". The next logical step in migrating the test case would be to verify the weather information for London, which aligns with the source test case's intention of checking weather-related data.

Since we're now on a page that likely displays weather information for London, we should look for elements that correspond to temperature, wind, and rain data, similar to what we were verifying in the source test case. However, the exact layout and element IDs may differ in this target application.

Here's the next step I propose:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (), contains, "Temperature"):Verify that there is a TextView containing the word "Temperature" to confirm we are on the weather details page
~~~

This assertion aims to confirm that we have successfully navigated to a page displaying weather information, specifically looking for temperature data. If this assertion passes, we can proceed with further checks for wind and rain data in subsequent steps.
Based on the provided action, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

```
assert d(className="android.widget.TextView", text="Temperature").exists()
```

This code asserts that there is a TextView containing the word "Temperature" on the current screen, which confirms that we are on the weather details page. The `exists()` method is used to check for the presence of the element, and the `className` and `text` attributes are used to identify the specific TextView we're looking for.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully navigated to the weather details page for London. Let's continue with the next step in the source test case, which involves verifying the temperature graph label. Here's the next action we should take:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (), contains, "Temperature, °C"):Verify that the temperature graph label displays "Temperature, °C"
~~~

This assertion aims to check if there's a TextView containing the exact phrase "Temperature, °C" on the current page, which corresponds to step 4 in the source test case. We're adapting the assertion to match the current app's structure while maintaining the same functional purpose.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code conversion for the given action:

···
assert "Temperature, °C" in d(className="android.widget.TextView").get_text()
···

This code checks if the text "Temperature, °C" is contained within any TextView on the screen. Since no specific coordinates or resource ID were provided, this assertion will check all TextViews present in the current view.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully navigated to the weather details page for London and verified the presence of temperature information. The next step in the source test case is to verify the wind and rain graph labels. Let's proceed with these verifications:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (), contains, "Wind, m/s"):Verify that the wind graph label displays "Wind, m/s"
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (), contains, "Rain, mm"):Verify that the rain graph label displays "Rain, mm"
~~~

These assertions will check if the wind and rain graph labels are present and correctly displayed on the weather details page for London. If these assertions pass, we can move on to the next steps in the test case. If they fail, we may need to adjust our approach or explore the interface further to locate the correct elements.
Based on the provided actions, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
assert "Wind, m/s" in d(className="android.widget.TextView").get_text()
assert "Rain, mm" in d(className="android.widget.TextView").get_text()
···

These assertions check if the specified text is contained within any TextView on the screen. Since no specific coordinates or IDs were provided, we're using the className to identify the TextViews and then checking their text content.

Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case semantics, it appears that we have successfully navigated to the weather details page for London and verified the presence of temperature, wind, and rain labels. The next step in the source test case involves interacting with the overflow menu to toggle values. Let's proceed with this step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (264, 28), click, NULL):Click on the overflow menu button to open additional options
~~~

This action attempts to open the overflow menu, which is typically located in the top-right corner of the screen. The coordinates (264, 28) are an estimate based on the standard position of the overflow menu button in Android applications. If this action fails, we may need to adjust the coordinates or look for a different method to access these options.
Based on the provided action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(264, 28)
···

This code uses the coordinates (264, 28) to click on the overflow menu button, which is the most precise and efficient method as per the given requirements. The device variable name 'd' is used as specified in the input.

Based on the executed action sequence and the current state of the test migration, it appears that we have successfully navigated to the weather details page for London and verified the presence of temperature, wind, and rain labels. The next step in the source test case is to toggle the values. Let's proceed with this step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, , (177, 41), click, NULL):Click on "Toggle Values" option in the overflow menu to toggle the display of values on the graphs
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (), contains, "Temperature, °C"):Verify that the temperature graph label still displays "Temperature, °C" after toggling values
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (), contains, "Wind, m/s"):Verify that the wind graph label still displays "Wind, m/s" after toggling values
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (), contains, "Rain, mm"):Verify that the rain graph label still displays "Rain, mm" after toggling values
~~~

This action attempts to toggle the values on the graphs and then verifies that the labels remain unchanged after the toggle. If this action is successful, we'll move on to the next step in the source test case. If it fails, we'll need to reassess and potentially look for alternative ways to achieve this functionality in the target app.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the provided actions:

···
d.click(177, 41)

assert "Temperature, °C" in d(className="android.widget.TextView").get_text()
assert "Wind, m/s" in d(className="android.widget.TextView").get_text()
assert "Rain, mm" in d(className="android.widget.TextView").get_text()
···

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the "Toggle Values" option in the overflow menu using the provided coordinates.
2. Verifies that the temperature graph label still contains "Temperature, °C" after toggling values.
3. Verifies that the wind graph label still contains "Wind, m/s" after toggling values.
4. Verifies that the rain graph label still contains "Rain, mm" after toggling values.

Note that for the assertions, we're using a general approach to check if the text is present in any TextView on the screen, as specific coordinates or IDs were not provided for these elements.

ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (), contains, "Rain, mm"):Verify that the rain graph label still displays "Rain, mm" after toggling Y-Axis
~~~

This response covers steps 12 through 16 of the source test case. We're opening the overflow menu again, selecting the "Toggle Y-Axis" option, and then verifying that the graph labels remain correct after this action.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(264, 28)
d.click(177, 41)
assert "Temperature, °C" in d(className="android.widget.TextView").get_text()
assert "Wind, m/s" in d(className="android.widget.TextView").get_text()
assert "Rain, mm" in d(className="android.widget.TextView").get_text()
···

This code does the following:
1. Clicks on the overflow menu button using coordinates.
2. Clicks on the "Toggle Y-Axis" option using coordinates.
3. Verifies that the temperature graph label still contains "Temperature, °C".
4. Verifies that the wind graph label still contains "Wind, m/s".
5. Verifies that the rain graph label still contains "Rain, mm".

Note: For the assertions, we're using a more general approach since specific coordinates or IDs weren't provided. The code checks if the specified texts are present in any TextView on the screen.
