#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated the first three steps of the source test case. Let's proceed with the next step, which is to verify that "Moscow" is displayed in the city list. Here's the next action to take:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (72, 38), "Moscow, RU"): Verify that "Moscow, RU" is displayed as the current city in the weather information page.
~~~

This assertion checks if the city name "Moscow, RU" is displayed in the TextView at the top of the weather information page, which corresponds to the verification step in the source test case. The coordinates (72, 38) are used instead of the specific ID from the source test case, as we're working with a different application that may have a different structure.

If this assertion passes, we can consider the test case migration complete. If it fails, we may need to investigate further or consider alternative ways to verify the city selection.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given assertion:

···
assert d(text="Moscow, RU").exists()
···

This code checks if the text "Moscow, RU" exists on the screen, which verifies that "Moscow, RU" is displayed as the current city in the weather information page. Since the coordinates are provided but not precise enough for a click operation, and there's no unique ID given, using the text attribute is the most reliable method in this case.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated the test case for searching and adding Moscow to the weather application. Let's analyze the current state and determine the next step:

1. We've clicked the search button (in this case, it was an options menu).
2. We've entered "Moscow" into the search field.
3. We've selected Moscow from the search results.
4. We've verified that Moscow is now displayed as the current city.

These steps correspond to all four steps in the source test case. Therefore, we can conclude that the test case migration is complete.

Here's the response in the required format:

~~~
DONE
~~~

This response indicates that we have successfully matched and executed all steps of the source test case in the target application. The test case migration is complete, and no further actions are needed.
I understand that you've provided the device variable name as 'd', and you're expecting me to convert Actions into UIAutomator2 code. However, you haven't provided any specific Actions to convert. The "DONE" at the end suggests that there are no Actions to process in this instance.

If you have any specific Actions that you'd like me to convert into UIAutomator2 code, please provide them in the format you described earlier:

ACTION (element, id, coordinates, action, value):purpose

Once you provide the Actions, I'll be happy to convert them into the appropriate UIAutomator2 code using the device variable 'd' and following the guidelines you've specified.
