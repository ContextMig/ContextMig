#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with clicking on the "Extras" menu item in the toolbar. Let's find the closest match in the target application's current page intentions.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (280, 28), click, NULL): Click to open options menu. The menu displays items including "Weather Map", "Graphs", "Detect Location", "Settings", and "About".
~~~

This action seems to be the closest match to the source test case's first step of opening the "Extras" menu. It opens an options menu that includes "Settings", which is what we're looking for in the next step of the source test case.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the described action:

···
d.click(280, 28)
···

This code will click on the ImageView at the coordinates (280, 28) to open the options menu. The menu will display items including "Weather Map", "Graphs", "Detect Location", "Settings", and "About".
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (120, 28), click, NULL): Click on the "Weather Map" option in the menu. This action does not navigate to a new page, as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON, indicating that the menu remains open after the click.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/title, (136, 41), click, "Weather Map"): Click on "Weather Map" to open the weather map page. The new page displays a WebView with zoom controls and a bottom bar with options for Rain, Wind, and Temperature map layers.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/title, (136, 137), click, "Detect Location"): Click to detect the current location. A dialog appears with a message "Getting your location ..." and a "CANCEL" button with id "android:id/button2".

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to click on the "Extras" menu item in the toolbar, which seems to correspond to opening the options menu in the target app. This action has already been executed successfully.

The next step in the source test case is to click on the "Settings" option in the submenu. In the target app, we can see that there is a "Settings" option available in the opened menu. Therefore, we should proceed with clicking on this option.

Here's the next action to take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/title, (136, 185), click, NULL):Click on "Settings" to navigate to the Settings page
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 in the source test case, where we click on the "Settings" option. By executing this action, we should navigate to the Settings page in the target app, which will allow us to proceed with the subsequent steps of changing a custom setting value.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```
d.click(136, 185)
```

This code uses the coordinates provided (136, 185) to perform a click action on the "Settings" element. As per the requirements, using coordinates is preferred when they are precise, which is the case here.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully navigated to the Settings page of the target application. Now, let's proceed with the next step of the test case migration.

The next step in the source test case is to click on the 9th item (index 8) in the settings list. In the target application, we need to find a similar setting that matches the functionality we're testing, which is changing a custom setting value.

From the current page's intent description, we can see that there's an option for "Custom Date Format" which seems to be the closest match to a custom setting. Let's proceed with this option.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (16, 574), click, "Custom Date Format"): Click to open a dialog for customizing the date format.
~~~

This action should open a dialog for customizing the date format, which is similar to the custom setting in the source test case. If this action is successful, we can proceed to the next step of inputting a custom value.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(16, 574)
···

This code uses the coordinates (16, 574) to perform the click action, which is the preferred method as specified in the requirements. The action will open a dialog for customizing the date format by clicking on the "Custom Date Format" TextView.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (48, 235), click, "Custom Date Format"): Click on the title of the Custom Date Format dialog. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the dialog remains unchanged after the interaction.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, android:id/edit, (44, 283), click, NULL): Click to focus on the EditText field for entering a custom date format. The dialog remains open with the same elements, allowing the user to input their desired format.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (143, 353), click, "CANCEL"): Click to cancel the custom date format input and return to the Settings page without making changes. The next page shows the main Settings screen with options for Units, Temperature, Length, Speed, Pressure, and Date Format.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (220, 353), click, "OK"): Click to confirm and save the custom date format. The page returns to the Settings screen with updated date format options.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the step of inputting a custom date format in the target application. This corresponds to step 4 in the source test case, where a custom value is being entered. Let's proceed with the next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, android:id/edit, (44, 283), click, NULL): Click to focus on the EditText field for entering a custom date format
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, android:id/edit, (44, 283), input, "none"): Input the text "none" into the custom date format field
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (220, 353), click, "OK"): Click to confirm and save the custom date format
~~~

This response combines the actions of focusing on the input field, entering the custom value "none", and confirming the input, which aligns with steps 4 and 5 of the source test case. The "OK" button in the target app corresponds to the "Confirm" button in the source test case.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the described actions:

···
d.click(44, 283)
d(resourceId="android:id/edit").set_text("none")
d.click(220, 353)
···

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clicks on the EditText field at coordinates (44, 283) to focus on it.
2. Inputs the text "none" into the EditText field using its resource ID.
3. Clicks on the "OK" button at coordinates (220, 353) to confirm and save the custom date format.

4. We've confirmed the input by clicking the OK button.

These actions correspond to steps 1-5 of the source test case. The migration has been successful so far, and we have completed all the steps in the source test case.

Given this, we can conclude that the test case migration is complete. Here's the response:

~~~
DONE

This response indicates that we have successfully migrated all steps of the source test case to the target application. The test case has been fully executed, matching the functionality of changing a custom setting value in the settings menu.
I understand that you want me to convert Android test semantic descriptions into UIAutomator2 code in Python. However, you haven't provided any specific actions to convert in your last message. You only mentioned the device variable name as 'd' and said "DONE" under Actions.

Without any specific actions to convert, I cannot generate any UIAutomator2 code. If you have any specific actions you'd like me to convert, please provide them in the format you described earlier:

ACTION (element, id, coordinates, action, value):purpose

Once you provide the actions, I'll be happy to convert them into UIAutomator2 code following the guidelines and format you specified.
