Based on the provided Android test case, I'll generate a corresponding function description following the specified format:

```
This test case is verifying the theme selection functionality in the settings menu of the Good Weather application.

The detailed process with serial numbers is as follows:

1. ACTION (ImageButton, , (), click, NULL):Click on the navigation drawer button to open the side menu.

2. ACTION (NavigationMenuItemView, , (), click, NULL):Click on the fifth item in the navigation menu (likely the Settings option).

3. ACTION (LinearLayout, android.R.id:list, (), click, NULL):Click on the first item in the settings list.

4. ACTION (LinearLayout, android.R.id:list, (), click, NULL):Click on the fifth item in the sub-settings list (likely the Theme option).

5. ACTION (CheckedTextView, , (), click, NULL):Select the second option in the theme selection dialog (Dark theme).

6. ASSERT (TextView, android.R.id:summary, (), "Dark"):Verify that the selected theme summary text displays "Dark".

7. RETURN:Return to the previous state by pressing the back button multiple times to close all activities.
```

This function description outlines the steps to navigate through the app's settings, change the theme to Dark, and verify the change. It also includes a cleanup step to return to the initial state of the app.
