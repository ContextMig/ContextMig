#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that the source test case is currently at step 2, which is:

```
2. ACTION (NavigationMenuItemView, , (), click, NULL):Click on the fifth item in the navigation menu (likely the Settings option).
```

And the executed actions so far are:

```
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (280, 28), click, NULL):Click to open options menu to access Settings, Exec_Success
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/title, (136, 185), click, "Settings"):Click on "Settings" to open the settings page, Exec_Success
```

These actions seem to align with step 2 of the source test case, which is to navigate to the Settings page.

Given the current page's intentions, the next step should be:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, android:id/list, (0, 80), click, NULL):Click on the settings list to navigate through different setting options.
~~~

This action matches the semantics of step 3 in the source test case:

```
3. ACTION (LinearLayout, android.R.id:list, (), click, NULL):Click on the first item in the settings list.
```

By clicking on the settings list, we can proceed to the next step of navigating through the settings options.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, I'll convert them into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Here's the implementation:

```
# Click on the fifth item in the navigation menu (likely the Settings option)
d.click(280, 28)

# Click on "Settings" to open the settings page
d(text="Settings").click()

# Click on the settings list to navigate through different setting options
d.click(0, 80)

# Click on the first item in the settings list
d(resourceId="android:id/list").child(className="android.widget.LinearLayout", instance=0).click()
```

This code follows the given actions and adheres to the requirements:
1. It uses coordinates when they are provided and precise.
2. It uses the text attribute when it's confirmed (for the "Settings" click).
3. For the last action, since no coordinates were provided, it uses the resourceId and targets the first child LinearLayout.
4. The code is wrapped in triple backticks as requested.
5. The device variable name 'd' is used as specified.

Each action is implemented as efficiently as possible, avoiding redundant or similar code snippets.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets

Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. We've already navigated to the Settings page, so we'll continue with selecting the appropriate setting option.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, android:id/list, (0, 80), click, NULL):Click on the first item in the settings list to access temperature units settings.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in the source test case, where we click on the first item in the settings list. In the target app, we're assuming that the temperature units setting is the first item in the list. If this assumption is incorrect, we may need to adjust our approach in the next step.
Based on the provided action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to click on the first item in the settings list:

···
d.click(0, 80)
···

I've used the coordinates (0, 80) as specified in the action description, which is the preferred method when precise coordinates are available. This will click on the first item in the settings list to access temperature units settings.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully navigated to the Settings page and clicked on the first item in the settings list. This corresponds to step 3 in the source test case. Now, we need to proceed with step 4, which involves clicking on the fifth item in the sub-settings list (likely the Theme option).

However, in the current target application, we don't see a direct "Theme" option. Instead, we have various unit settings. Since the goal is to change the theme, we should look for an option that might be related to the app's appearance. The closest match seems to be the temperature units setting, which could affect the app's display.

Let's proceed with selecting the temperature units:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (16, 132), click, "Temperature units"):Click to open temperature units selection dialog
~~~

This action should open a dialog with temperature unit options, which is the closest match to the theme selection in the source test case. After executing this action, we'll need to select an option from the dialog, similar to how we would select a theme in the source app.
Based on the provided action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(16, 132)
···

This code uses the coordinates (16, 132) to perform a click action, which should open the temperature units selection dialog. This approach is preferred as it directly uses the precise coordinates provided in the action description.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (40, 223), click, "Temperature units"): Click on the title to interact with the Temperature units dialog. The dialog remains open, showing options for Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin temperature units.
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 307), click, "Fahrenheit"): Click to change the temperature unit to Fahrenheit. The page after clicking does not navigate, but the selected temperature unit changes.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (215, 407), click, "CANCEL"): Click the CANCEL button to dismiss the temperature units selection dialog and return to the main settings page without changing the temperature unit.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently at step 3 of the source test case, which involves selecting a specific setting option. In the target app, we have already navigated to the settings page and opened the temperature units selection dialog. The next logical step would be to select a specific temperature unit, which aligns with step 5 in the source test case (selecting a theme option).

Given the current page's intentions and the progress so far, here's the next action to take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 307), click, "Fahrenheit"):Click to change the temperature unit to Fahrenheit
~~~

This action corresponds to selecting a specific option in the settings, similar to selecting the Dark theme in the source test case. Although the specific setting (temperature unit vs. theme) is different, the functional similarity of selecting a preference option is maintained.

After this action, we should verify if the selection was applied correctly, similar to step 6 in the source test case. However, we don't have information about how the selected temperature unit is displayed on the settings page. We'll need to wait for the result of this action and the next page's intentions to determine how to perform the verification step.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code for the given action:

···

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have progressed through several steps of the test case migration. We've navigated to the settings page and accessed the temperature units settings. The next logical step would be to verify the selected temperature unit and then proceed to the theme selection, which is the main focus of the source test case. Here's the next action to take:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/summary, (16, 132), "Fahrenheit"):Verify that the selected temperature unit is now set to Fahrenheit
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, android:id/list, (0, 80), click, NULL):Click on the settings list to navigate to the theme option
~~~

This response includes an assertion to verify the temperature unit change, which wasn't explicitly part of the original test case but is a good practice to ensure the previous action was successful. Then, we proceed to navigate through the settings list to find the theme option, which corresponds to step 3 in the source test case.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given actions:

```
assert d(resourceId="android:id/summary", text="Fahrenheit").exists()
d.click(0, 80)
```

This code first asserts that the temperature unit is set to Fahrenheit by checking for the existence of a TextView with the specified resource ID and text. Then it clicks on the settings list at the given coordinates to navigate to the theme option.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (16, 628), click, "Theme"):Click on "Theme" to open a dialog with theme options
~~~

This action corresponds to step 4 in the source test case, where we click on the theme option in the settings list. The next step would be to select the Dark theme from the dialog that appears.
Based on the provided action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(16, 628)
···

This code uses the coordinates (16, 628) to click on the "Theme" option, which should open a dialog with theme options. The coordinate-based approach is preferred as per the requirements, and it's the most precise way to interact with the specific location on the screen.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 235), click, "Fresh Dark"):Click to select the "Fresh Dark" theme option, which is closest to the "Dark" theme in the source test case
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/summary, (16, 628), "Fresh Dark"):Verify that the selected theme summary text displays "Fresh Dark"
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've reached step 5 in the source test case, which involves selecting the Dark theme.
2. In the target app, we have options for "Fresh", "Classic", "Fresh Dark", and "Classic Dark" themes.
3. The closest match to the "Dark" theme from the source test case is "Fresh Dark" in the target app.
4. After selecting the theme, we assert that the summary text has been updated to reflect the new theme.

This action corresponds to steps 5 and 6 of the source test case, adapting to the available options in the target app. The next step would be to return to the previous state, but we'll wait for confirmation of this action's success before proceeding.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(16, 235)
assert d(resourceId="android:id/summary").get_text() == "Fresh Dark"

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
RETURN:Return to the previous state by pressing the back button to close the settings activity and return to the main screen
~~~

Explanation:
1. We have successfully navigated through the settings, changed the theme to "Fresh Dark" (which is the closest equivalent to "Dark" in the source test case), and verified the change.
2. The next step in the source test case is to return to the previous state by pressing the back button multiple times to close all activities.
3. In the target app, we only need to return once to get back to the main screen from the settings page.
4. This action aligns with step 7 of the source test case, which is the final step.

After this action is executed, we can consider the test case migration complete, as we have covered all the steps from the source test case. The next response should be "DONE" if this action is successful.
Based on the provided action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to return to the previous state:

···
d.press('back')
···

This code uses the device variable 'd' as specified, and performs a simple back button press to close the settings activity and return to the main screen.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll continue the test case migration:

~~~
RETURN:Return to the main screen to complete the test case
DONE
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already completed the main steps of the source test case:
   - Navigated to the settings
   - Changed the theme to a dark option ("Fresh Dark" instead of just "Dark")
   - Verified the theme change
   
2. The last step in the source test case is to return to the previous state. We've already returned from the theme selection dialog to the settings page.

3. The final action needed is to return from the settings page to the main screen, which completes the test case migration.

4. After this return action, all steps of the source test case have been successfully migrated to the target app, so we can conclude with DONE.
Based on the provided action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.press('back')
···

This code uses the device variable name 'd' as specified, and implements the RETURN action by pressing the back button to return to the main screen, effectively completing the test case.
