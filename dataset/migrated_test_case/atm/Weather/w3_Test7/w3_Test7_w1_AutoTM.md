#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with clicking on the "Extras" menu item in the toolbar. Let's find a similar action in the target application to start our migration.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (280, 28), click, NULL):Click to open the options menu. The menu includes items for Weather Map, Graphs, Detect Location, Settings, and About.
~~~

This action seems to be the closest match to the source test case's first step. It opens the options menu, which likely contains the "About" option we're looking for. Let's proceed with this action as our first step in the migration process.
Based on the provided action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to click on the specified coordinates to open the options menu:

···
d.click(280, 28)
···

This code uses the device variable 'd' as specified in the device variable name, and clicks on the coordinates (280, 28) to open the options menu. This action should trigger the menu to appear, showing items for Weather Map, Graphs, Detect Location, Settings, and About.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (120, 28), click, NULL): Click on the "Weather Map" option in the menu. This action does not navigate to a new page, as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON, indicating that the menu remains open after the click.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/title, (136, 41), click, "Weather Map"): Click on "Weather Map" to open the weather map page. The new page displays a WebView with zoom controls and a bottom bar with options for Rain, Wind, and Temperature map layers.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/title, (136, 137), click, "Detect Location"): Click to detect the current location. A dialog appears with a message "Getting your location ..." and a "CANCEL" button with id "android:id/button2".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/title, (136, 185), click, "Settings"): Click on "Settings" to navigate to the Settings page, which includes various options such as Temperature units, Length units, Speed units, and Pressure units.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/title, (136, 233), click, "About"): Click on the "About" option to open the About dialog, which displays information about the app including its version, developers, data sources, and licensing details.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the first step of the test case migration. The source test case aims to access the "About" section from the main menu, and we have successfully opened the options menu in the target app. Let's proceed with the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/title, (136, 233), click, NULL):Click on the "About" option to open the About dialog, which displays information about the app including its version, developers, data sources, and licensing details.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 in the source test case, where we click on the "About" option. In the target app, we have a direct "About" option in the menu, so we can click it directly without needing an intermediate "Extras" submenu as in the source app.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

```
d.click(136, 233)
```

This code uses the coordinates (136, 233) to click on the "About" option, which should open the About dialog displaying information about the app.

#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/alertTitle, (40, 141), click, "Forecastie"): Click on the "Forecastie" title. This action does not navigate to a new page or cause any visible changes in the UI elements.
ACTION (android.webkit.WebView, , (48, 169), click, NULL): Click on the WebView to view information about the app. No new page appears, but the WebView contains details about the app version, developer, data source, and icon credits.
ACTION (android.view.View, , (56, 177), click, "1.5"): Click on the app version number. This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes in the UI.
ACTION (android.view.View, , (56, 212), click, "A lightweight, opensource weather app."): Click on the app description to view more details. No new page appears, as the current and next JSON are identical, indicating no change in the UI after this interaction.
ACTION (android.view.View, , (56, 266), click, NULL): Click on "Developed by" to view developer information. The page remains the same after clicking this control, with no new elements appearing.
ACTION (android.view.View, , (56, 339), click, "OpenWeatherMap"): Click on the "OpenWeatherMap" text to view more information about the data provider. No new page appears, but it may open a web link to OpenWeatherMap's website in an external browser.
ACTION (android.view.View, , (184, 339), click, ", under the"): Click on the text ", under the" to view more information about the Creative Commons license. The page remains the same after this action, as it's part of a static information display.
ACTION (android.view.View, NULL, (56, 358), click, "Creative Commons license"): Click on the Creative Commons license text to view more information about the license. No new page or widgets appear after this action.
ACTION (android.view.View, , (56, 393), click, NULL): Click on the "Icons are" text to view information about the weather icons used in the app. No new page appears, but the same dialog remains open with details about the icons, including that they are "Weather Icons" by Lukas Bischoff and Erik Flowers, under the SIL OFL 1.1 license.
ACTION (android.view.View, , (125, 393), click, "Weather Icons"): Click on "Weather Icons" text to view information about the weather icons used in the app. No new page or widgets appear after this interaction.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (228, 489), click, "OK"): Click the OK button to dismiss the About dialog. The page remains the same after clicking this button, as it simply closes the dialog without navigating to a new page.
ACTION (android.view.View, NULL, (56, 412), click, "Lukas Bischoff"): Click on the developer's name "Lukas Bischoff". This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes in the UI.
ACTION (android.view.View, , (56, 412), click, "Erik Flowers"): Click on "Erik Flowers" to potentially open a link or display more information about this person. No new page or widgets appear after this action.
ACTION (android.view.View, , (56, 431), click, "SIL OFL 1.1"): Click on the "SIL OFL 1.1" text to view more information about the license. No new page or widgets appear after this action.
ACTION (android.view.View, licence, (78, 450), click, NULL): Click on the "licence" text to view more information about the SIL OFL 1.1 license. However, clicking this element does not lead to a new page or show new widgets.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently at the step where the "About" dialog has been opened in the target application. This corresponds to step 2 in the source test case. The next step in the source test case is to verify that the text "About" is displayed on the screen. Let's proceed with this verification:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/alertTitle, (40, 141), matches, "Forecastie"):Verify that the title of the About dialog is displayed, confirming that the About page has been opened successfully.
~~~

I've made this assertion based on the available information in the current page's intent description. The element with the title "Forecastie" seems to be the closest match to the "About" text we're looking for in the source test case. While it's not an exact match, it serves the same purpose of confirming that we've successfully navigated to the About section.

After this assertion, we've completed all the steps in the source test case. However, to ensure we've fully explored the About dialog and to match the functionality of viewing the About information, we should add one more action to dismiss the dialog:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (228, 489), click, NULL):Click the OK button to dismiss the About dialog and return to the main screen.
DONE
~~~

This action closes the About dialog, completing our interaction with the About section. The DONE statement indicates that we have successfully migrated all steps of the source test case to the target application.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the provided actions:

···
assert d(resourceId="cz.martykan.forecastie:id/alertTitle").get_text() == "Forecastie"
d.click(228, 489)
···

This code first asserts that the title of the About dialog is "Forecastie", verifying that the About page has been opened successfully. Then it clicks the OK button at the coordinates (228, 489) to dismiss the About dialog and return to the main screen.
