#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with clicking on the second tab in the tab layout. However, the target application doesn't seem to have a tab layout on the current page. Instead, it appears to be a weather application with various weather information displayed.

Let's try to find a similar functionality that could represent switching to a different view or section of the app. The navigation drawer seems to be a good candidate for this.

Here's the suggested next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, , (0, 24), click, NULL): Click to open the navigation drawer, revealing menu options including "Current Weather", "Graphs", "Daily Forecast", "Settings", "Feedback", and "Donate Bitcoin".
~~~

This action opens the navigation drawer, which could potentially lead to different sections of the app, similar to how tabs work in the source application. After this action is executed, we can evaluate the new state of the app and determine which option in the navigation drawer might correspond to the "second tab" in the source test case.
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(0, 24)
···

This code clicks on the specified coordinates (0, 24) to open the navigation drawer. Since precise coordinates are provided, we use them directly in the `click()` method of the UIAutomator2 device object `d`.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to click on the second tab in the tab layout. However, the target application doesn't seem to have a tab layout on the current page. Instead, it has a navigation drawer that has been opened. 

Let's try to find a functionally similar action that could correspond to switching to a different view or section of the app. The "Graphs" option in the navigation drawer seems to be a good candidate, as it likely represents a different view of weather information, similar to what a second tab might show in the source application.

Here's the next step I propose:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, org.asdtm.goodweather:id/design_menu_item_text, (16, 216), click, "Graphs"): Click to navigate to the Graphs Weather page, which should display weather information in a graphical format.
~~~

This action should navigate to a different view of the weather information, which is functionally similar to switching to a second tab in the source application. After this action is executed, we can then verify if the Graphs page is displayed and proceed with the next steps of the test case migration.
Based on the provided action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d.click(16, 216)
···

This code uses the coordinates (16, 216) to click on the "Graphs" menu item. This is the optimal choice as you mentioned that using coordinates is preferred when they are precise. The click action will navigate to the Graphs Weather page as described in the purpose of the action.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided information, we are currently at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case is about verifying tab navigation in a weather application, while the target application seems to have a different structure with a navigation drawer instead of tabs. Let's proceed with the migration:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (72, 38), isDisplayed): Verify that the "Graphs Weather" page is displayed after navigating to it.
ACTION (android.widget.ScrollView, , (0, 80), click, NULL): Scroll through the weather graphs to simulate moving between different sections (similar to tab navigation in the source app).
~~~

Explanation:
1. We first assert that we are on the correct page ("Graphs Weather") after navigating to it. This corresponds to verifying the tab display in the source test case.
2. Since the target app doesn't have tabs but instead uses a scrollable view for different graphs, we simulate the tab navigation by scrolling through the weather graphs. This action is similar to moving between tabs in the source app.

We've completed the first step of the source test case (clicking on the second tab) by navigating to the Graphs page and asserting its display. The scrolling action simulates moving to another section, which is analogous to moving to the third tab in the source test case.
Based on the provided Actions, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
assert d(text="Graphs Weather").exists()
d.swipe(0, 80, 0, 400)
···

Explanation:
1. For the ASSERT action, we check if the "Graphs Weather" text is displayed on the screen using the `exists()` method.
2. For the ACTION on the ScrollView, since we don't have specific coordinates for scrolling, I've used a general swipe action from top to bottom to simulate scrolling through the weather graphs. The swipe starts at (0, 80) and moves downward to (0, 400). You may need to adjust these coordinates based on the specific device and app layout.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully navigated to the "Graphs Weather" page and performed a scrolling action, which is analogous to the tab navigation in the source test case. Let's continue with the next step in the migration process.

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, org.asdtm.goodweather:id/graphs_wind_label, (16, 373), isDisplayed): Verify that the "Wind, m/s" label is displayed after scrolling, simulating the visibility check of the third tab in the source test case.
~~~

This assertion checks if the "Wind, m/s" label is visible after scrolling, which corresponds to verifying the visibility of the third tab in the source test case. We're adapting the test case to the structure of the target app, where scrolling through different sections of the graph replaces tab navigation.
Based on the given input, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to verify that the "Wind, m/s" label is displayed:

···
assert d(resourceId="org.asdtm.goodweather:id/graphs_wind_label").exists(), "Wind, m/s label is not displayed"
···

This code checks if the element with the specified resource ID exists, which simulates the visibility check of the "Wind, m/s" label. The assertion will raise an exception if the element is not found, effectively verifying that it is displayed.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated the first three steps of the source test case. We have navigated to the Graphs Weather page, which is functionally similar to clicking on different tabs in the source app. We've also performed scrolling to simulate moving between different sections, which is analogous to switching tabs.

The next step in the source test case is to click on the third tab and verify its display. In our target app, we've already scrolled to reveal the "Wind, m/s" section, which is analogous to the third tab. We've also verified its visibility. 

To complete the migration of the source test case, we should perform one more action to ensure we've fully explored the available graph sections, similar to how the source test case checked all tabs. Let's scroll back to the top to view the temperature graph, which would be analogous to switching back to an earlier tab.

Here's the next step in our test migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ScrollView, , (0, 80), click, NULL): Scroll back to the top of the page to view the temperature graph, simulating switching back to an earlier tab.
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, org.asdtm.goodweather:id/graphs_temperature_label, (16, 96), isDisplayed): Verify that the "Temperature, °C" label is displayed after scrolling back up, simulating the visibility check of an earlier tab in the source test case.
DONE
~~~

This action completes our test case migration by ensuring we've interacted with and verified the visibility of both main sections of the Graphs Weather page, which is functionally equivalent to checking all tabs in the source test case. The DONE statement indicates that we have successfully migrated all steps of the source test case to the target app.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the described operations:

···
d.click(0, 80)
assert d(resourceId="org.asdtm.goodweather:id/graphs_temperature_label").exists()
···

This code does the following:

1. Clicks at the coordinates (0, 80) to simulate scrolling back to the top of the page.
2. Asserts that the "Temperature, °C" label is displayed by checking if the element with the specified resource ID exists.

Note: The code uses the coordinate-based click as requested, and for the assertion, it uses the resource ID since it's unique and non-empty. The `exists()` method is used to check if the element is displayed, which is equivalent to the `isDisplayed` check in the original test case.
