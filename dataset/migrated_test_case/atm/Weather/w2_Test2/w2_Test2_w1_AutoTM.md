#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to click on the search city menu item. Let's find the corresponding action in the target app:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/action_search, (232, 28), click, NULL): Click to open the search dialog. The next page shows a search dialog with a title "Search for city", an EditText for input, and two buttons "CANCEL" and "OK".
~~~

This action corresponds to the first step in the source test case, as it opens the search interface for cities. The next step would be to input the city name "Atlanta" into the search field, but we need to wait for the confirmation that this action was executed successfully before proceeding.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code for the given action:

···
d.click(232, 28)
···

This code uses the coordinate-based click operation, which is the preferred method as per the instructions. The action clicks on the search icon located at coordinates (232, 28) to open the search dialog.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/alertTitle, (48, 275), click, "Search for city"): Click on the title of the search dialog. This action does not lead to a new page or cause any visible changes in the dialog's structure.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, , (56, 303), click, NULL): Click on the search input field to enter a city name. The page remains the same with the search dialog open, containing an editable text field for city input and "CANCEL" and "OK" buttons.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (143, 355), click, "CANCEL"): Click to cancel the search operation and return to the main weather display page showing current weather conditions for Atlanta, US.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (220, 355), click, "OK"): Click OK button to confirm the city search. This action returns to the main weather forecast page for the searched city, showing updated weather information including temperature, description, wind, pressure, humidity, and sunrise/sunset times.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case has been completed, which is opening the search interface. Now, we need to proceed with inputting the city name. Here's the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, , (56, 303), input, "Atlanta"): Input the city name "Atlanta" into the search field.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 in the source test case. We're using the EditText field provided in the current page's intent description to input the city name "Atlanta". This aligns with the functionality of searching for a specific city in both the source and target applications.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d.click(56, 303)
d.send_keys("Atlanta")
···

This code first clicks on the specified coordinates (56, 303) where the EditText field is located, and then inputs the text "Atlanta" into the field. Since the widget ID is not provided, we use the coordinates for the click action and then use send_keys() to input the text.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/alertTitle, (48, 254), click, "Search for city"): Click on the title of the search dialog. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the dialog remains unchanged after the interaction.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, , (56, 282), click, "Atlanta"): Click to select the text "Atlanta" in the search input field. No new page or widgets appear after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (143, 334), click, "CANCEL"): Click the "CANCEL" button to dismiss the search dialog and return to the main weather display for Atlanta, US. The main page shows weather information including temperature, wind speed, pressure, humidity, and sunrise/sunset times.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (220, 334), click, "OK"): Click the OK button to confirm the city search for "Atlanta". This action navigates to the weather forecast page for Atlanta, displaying current weather conditions including temperature, wind speed, pressure, humidity, and sunrise/sunset times.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I can determine that we are currently at the second step of the test migration process. The source test case has already completed the search menu item click and the city name input. Now, we need to proceed with confirming the search. Here's the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (220, 334), click, NULL):Click the OK button to confirm the city search for "Atlanta" and navigate to the weather forecast page for Atlanta.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 3 in the source test case, where the user clicks on the first item in the search results list. In this target application, instead of clicking on a search result, we need to confirm the search by clicking the OK button. This should lead us to the weather information page for Atlanta, which aligns with the intention of the original test case.
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(220, 334)
···

This code uses the coordinates (220, 334) to click on the OK button, which confirms the city search for "Atlanta" and navigates to the weather forecast page for Atlanta. The coordinate-based approach is preferred as per the requirements, and it's the most precise method to interact with the specific UI element in this case.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), isDisplayed, "Atlanta, US"): Verify that the weather information for Atlanta is displayed by checking if the city name "Atlanta, US" is visible on the screen.
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've successfully completed the first three steps of the source test case: opening the search interface, inputting the city name "Atlanta", and selecting the search result.
2. The next logical step is to verify that the weather information for Atlanta is indeed displayed, which corresponds to step 4 in the source test case.
3. In the target app, we can confirm this by checking if the city name "Atlanta, US" is visible on the screen, which is represented by the TextView with coordinates (16, 38).
4. This assertion serves the same purpose as the FrameLayout check in the source test case, verifying that the correct content is displayed after the search operation.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to verify that the weather information for Atlanta is displayed:

···
assert d(text="Atlanta, US").exists()
···

This code checks if there's a TextView with the text "Atlanta, US" displayed on the screen. Since the coordinates are provided but not precise enough for a click operation, and there's no unique ID given, using the text attribute is the most reliable method in this case.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated the first three steps of the source test case and partially completed the fourth step. Let's proceed with the next step of the migration:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/todayTemperature, (16, 86), isDisplayed, NULL): Verify that the temperature for Atlanta is displayed, confirming that the weather information is shown.
~~~

This assertion corresponds to step 4 in the source test case, which verifies that the weather information for the searched city (Atlanta) is displayed. In the target app, we're specifically checking for the presence of the temperature widget, which is a key component of weather information.
Based on the given information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to verify that the temperature for Atlanta is displayed:

···
assert d(resourceId="cz.martykan.forecastie:id/todayTemperature").exists()
···

This code checks if the element with the specified resource ID exists on the screen, which confirms that the temperature is displayed. The assertion will pass if the element is found, indicating that the weather information is shown.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully completed the migration of the test case. Let's review the steps:

1. We clicked on the search button to open the search dialog, which corresponds to step 1 in the source test case.
2. We input "Atlanta" into the search field, which matches step 2 of the source test case.
3. We clicked the OK button to confirm the search, which is equivalent to step 3 in the source test case (clicking on the search result).
4. We verified that the weather information for Atlanta is displayed by checking the city name and temperature, which corresponds to step 4 in the source test case (verifying that the content is displayed).

The only step remaining is the return action. Let's execute that to complete the test case migration.

~~~
RETURN:Return to the previous state by closing the current activity and going back to the main screen.
DONE
~~~

This completes the migration of the test case. We have successfully searched for a city (Atlanta), verified the display of weather information, and included a return action to go back to the initial state. All steps from the source test case have been accounted for in the target application, albeit with some differences in the specific UI interactions due to the different app designs.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code for the given action:

···
d.press('back')
···

This code uses the device variable 'd' as specified in the input to press the back button, which will return to the previous state by closing the current activity and going back to the main screen.
