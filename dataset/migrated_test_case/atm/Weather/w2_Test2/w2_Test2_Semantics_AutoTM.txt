3. ACTION (RecyclerView, R.id.search_recycler_view, (), click, NULL): Click on the first item in the search results list.

4. ASSERT (FrameLayout, android.R.id.content, (), isDisplayed, NULL): Verify that the content frame layout is displayed, indicating the weather information for Atlanta is shown.

5. RETURN: Return to the previous state by pressing the back button multiple times to close all activities.
