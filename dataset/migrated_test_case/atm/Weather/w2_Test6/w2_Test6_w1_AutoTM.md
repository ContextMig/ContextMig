````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the Settings page of the target application. Let's proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, android:id/list, (0, 80), click, NULL):Click on the list view to interact with the settings options
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (16, 261), click, "Length units"):Click to open the Length units selection dialog
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already navigated to the Settings page, which corresponds to steps 1 and 2 in the source test case.
2. In the source test case, step 3 involves clicking on the first item in the settings list. However, in our target app, we don't have a direct match for language settings. The closest option we have is "Length units", which is also a settings option.
3. We first interact with the ListView to ensure it's active, then click on the "Length units" option to open its selection dialog.
4. This action aims to progress the test case by interacting with a similar type of setting, even though it's not an exact match for language settings.
Based on the provided actions, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

```
d.click(0, 80)
d(text="Length units").click()
```

This code first clicks on the list view at the specified coordinates (0, 80) to interact with the settings options. Then, it clicks on the "Length units" option using the text attribute, as it's a more reliable method than using coordinates for this specific action.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (40, 247), click, "Length units"): Click on the title of the length units selection dialog. This action does not navigate to a new page or change the current dialog, as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 283), click, "Millimeters (mm)"): Click to select Millimeters (mm) as the length unit. No navigation occurs, but the selection state of the CheckedTextView may change.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (215, 383), click, "CANCEL"): Click the CANCEL button to dismiss the Length units selection dialog without making changes. The page returns to the Settings screen with the Length units option still set to "Millimeters (mm)".

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at step 4 of the source test case, which involves selecting a specific setting option. In the target app, we have already navigated to the Settings page and opened the Length units selection dialog. The next logical step would be to select a specific length unit, which aligns with step 5 of the source test case (selecting a language option).

Given the current page's intentions and the executed action sequence, here's the next step for the test migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 283), click, "Millimeters (mm)"):Select Millimeters (mm) as the length unit, which corresponds to selecting a specific language in the source test case
~~~

This action matches the functionality of selecting an option from a list, similar to selecting a language in the source test case. After this action, we should proceed to confirm the selection, which would align with step 6 of the source test case.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the described action:

```
d(resourceId="android:id/text1", text="Millimeters (mm)").click()
```

This code will click on the CheckedTextView element with the text "Millimeters (mm)" to select it as the length unit. This action is equivalent to selecting a specific language in the source test case.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case semantics, it appears we have completed steps 1-5 of the source test case. We've navigated to the settings page and selected a specific option (Length units in this case, which corresponds to Language in the source test). The next step in the source test case is to confirm the selection. Let's proceed with that:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (240, 411), click, NULL):Click the OK button to confirm the length unit selection
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/summary, (16, 283), matches, "Millimeters (mm)"):Verify that the selected length unit is displayed as "Millimeters (mm)"
~~~

This action confirms the selection of the length unit, similar to confirming the language selection in the source test case. The assertion then verifies that the correct option is displayed, which aligns with step 7 of the source test case.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the provided actions:

```
d.click(240, 411)
assert d(resourceId="android:id/summary").get_text() == "Millimeters (mm)"
```

This code first clicks the OK button at the specified coordinates (240, 411) to confirm the length unit selection. Then, it verifies that the selected length unit is displayed as "Millimeters (mm)" by checking the text of the element with the resource ID "android:id/summary".
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (40, 199), click, "Pressure units"): Click on the title of the pressure units dialog. The dialog remains open with the same options for selecting pressure units (hPa, kPa, mm Hg, in Hg) and a CANCEL button.
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 235), click, "hPa"): Click to select hPa as the pressure unit. No new page appears, but the selected item may be highlighted or checked in the current dialog.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (215, 431), click, "CANCEL"): Click the CANCEL button to dismiss the pressure units selection dialog and return to the settings page without making any changes.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at step 7 of the source test case, which involves verifying the selected language. In the target app, we've already selected a length unit instead of a language. Let's proceed with the next step, which is returning to the initial state of the app.

~~~
RETURN:Perform back button press to return to the main screen of the app
~~~

This action corresponds to step 8 in the source test case, where multiple back button presses are performed to return to the initial state of the app. In the target app, we need to navigate back from the Settings page to the main screen.
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.press('back')
···

This code uses the device variable 'd' as specified in the Device Variable Name, and performs a back button press to return to the main screen of the app.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated steps 1 through 7 of the source test case. The last step remaining is to return to the initial state of the app. Let's proceed with that:

~~~
RETURN:Perform back button press to return to the main screen of the app
DONE
~~~

This action completes the migration of the test case. We've successfully changed a setting (in this case, the length unit instead of the language) and verified the change. The final step returns us to the main screen, which aligns with the last step of the source test case.

The migration is now complete, and all steps from the source test case have been addressed in the target application, albeit with some adaptations to fit the available functionality in the target app.
Based on the provided action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.press('back')
···

This code uses the device variable 'd' as specified in the device variable name, and performs a back button press to return to the main screen of the app.
