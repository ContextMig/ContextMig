#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, android:id/list, (0, 80), click, NULL):Click on the settings list to access various configuration options
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (16, 132), click, "Temperature units"):Click on "Temperature units" to open a dialog for selecting temperature units
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've successfully navigated to the settings page, which aligns with step 2 of the source test case.
2. The next step in the source test case is to click on the first item in the settings list. In our target app, we need to click on the "Temperature units" option specifically.
3. I've included two actions:
   - First, we click on the settings list to ensure it's active.
   - Then, we click on the "Temperature units" option to open the selection dialog.

This approach combines steps 3 and 4 of the source test case, as we're directly accessing the temperature unit settings in the target app.
Based on the provided actions, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(0, 80)
d(text="Temperature units").click()
···
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (40, 223), click, "Temperature units"): Click on the title to interact with the Temperature units dialog. The dialog remains open, showing options for Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin temperature units.
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 307), click, "Fahrenheit"): Click to change the temperature unit to Fahrenheit. The page after clicking does not navigate, but the selected temperature unit changes.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (215, 407), click, "CANCEL"): Click to cancel the temperature unit selection and return to the Settings page. The page after clicking this control is the Settings page, which contains various setting options such as Temperature units, Length units, Speed units, and Pressure units.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I can determine that we are currently at step 5 of the source test case, where we need to select a temperature unit. The executed actions so far have successfully navigated to the temperature unit selection dialog. Now, we need to select the Fahrenheit option, which corresponds to the second option in the source test case.

Here's the next action to perform:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 307), click, "Fahrenheit"):Click to change the temperature unit to Fahrenheit
~~~

This action matches the intention of selecting Fahrenheit as the temperature unit, which aligns with step 5 of the source test case. After this action, we should be able to proceed to the verification steps.
Based on the given action, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d(resourceId="android:id/text1", text="Fahrenheit").click()
···

This code uses the resourceId and text attributes to locate the specific CheckedTextView element with the text "Fahrenheit" and clicks on it. This approach is more reliable than using coordinates, as it ensures the correct element is clicked even if the UI layout changes slightly.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case semantics, we have successfully navigated to the settings page and changed the temperature unit to Fahrenheit. The next step in the source test case is to verify that the change has been applied correctly. Let's proceed with the assertion:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/summary, (16, 154), matches, "Fahrenheit"):Verify that the summary of the Temperature units setting displays "Fahrenheit"
~~~

This assertion checks if the temperature unit has been correctly set to Fahrenheit. If this assertion passes, we can move on to the next step in the test case. If it fails, we may need to investigate why the change wasn't applied correctly.
Based on the provided action and requirements, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code:

···
assert d(resourceId="android:id/summary", text="Fahrenheit").exists()
···

This code checks if there's a TextView with the resource ID "android:id/summary" and the text "Fahrenheit". It uses the `exists()` method to verify the presence of this element, which effectively asserts that the summary of the Temperature units setting displays "Fahrenheit".

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully completed steps 1 through 5 of the source test case. The temperature unit has been changed to Fahrenheit. Now, we need to verify the change and then return to the initial state. Here's the next step:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (16, 132), matches, "Temperature units"):Verify that the title of the selected setting is "Temperature units"
~~~

This assertion checks if the title of the temperature setting is correct, which aligns with step 6 of the source test case. We've adapted it slightly to match the actual text in the target app.
Based on the provided input, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to verify that the title of the selected setting is "Temperature units":

```
assert d(resourceId="android:id/title", text="Temperature units").exists()
```

This code checks if there's a TextView element with the resource ID "android:id/title" and the text "Temperature units". The `exists()` method returns True if such an element is found, satisfying the assertion.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated the core functionality of the source test case. Let's proceed with the final step of the test case:

~~~
RETURN:Close all activities and return to the initial state
DONE
~~~

Explanation:
1. We have successfully navigated to the settings menu.
2. We have selected and changed the temperature unit to Fahrenheit.
3. We have verified that the change has been applied correctly by asserting both the title and the summary of the temperature units setting.

The only remaining step from the source test case is to return to the initial state. After executing this step, we can consider the test case migration complete.
Based on the provided action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.app_stop_all()
d.app_start("package_name")  # Replace "package_name" with the actual package name of the app
···

Note: This code assumes that you want to close all activities and restart the app to return to its initial state. The `app_stop_all()` method closes all running apps, and `app_start()` launches the specified app. You'll need to replace "package_name" with the actual package name of the app you're testing.
