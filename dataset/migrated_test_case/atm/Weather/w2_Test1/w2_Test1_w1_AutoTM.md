#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to click on the search city menu item. Let's find the corresponding action in the target application.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/action_search, (232, 28), click, NULL): Click on the search icon to open the search dialog. The new dialog contains a search input field, a "CANCEL" button with id "android:id/button2", and an "OK" button with id "android:id/button1".
~~~

This action corresponds to the first step in the source test case, which is to open the search interface. The target application uses a search icon instead of a menu item, but the functionality is the same. After executing this action, we should be able to proceed to the next step of entering a city name.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the described action:

···
d.click(232, 28)
···

This code uses the coordinate-based click operation as specified in the requirements. It clicks on the search icon located at coordinates (232, 28) to open the search dialog.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/alertTitle, (48, 275), click, "Search for city"): Click on the title of the search dialog. This action does not lead to a new page or cause any visible changes in the dialog's structure.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, , (56, 303), click, NULL): Click on the search input field to enter a city name. The dialog remains open with the same elements, but the input field is now focused for text entry.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (143, 355), click, "CANCEL"): Click the "CANCEL" button to dismiss the search dialog and return to the main weather display page showing the current weather information for Atlanta, US.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (220, 355), click, "OK"): Click the OK button to confirm the city search. This action returns to the main weather page for Atlanta, US, showing updated weather information including temperature, wind, pressure, humidity, and forecast details.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've completed the first step of the source test case by clicking on the search icon.
2. The next step in the source test case is to input "Atlanta" into the search field.
3. In the target app, we have a search dialog open with an input field available.

Given this, here's the next action to take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, , (56, 303), input, "Atlanta"): Enter the city name "Atlanta" into the search field to prepare for searching weather information for Atlanta.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 of the source test case. We're using the EditText field in the search dialog to input the city name "Atlanta". This matches the functionality of the source test case, even though the exact UI elements and their IDs are different.
Based on the given action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to enter the city name "Atlanta" into the search field:

···
d.click(56, 303)
d.send_keys("Atlanta")
···

This code first clicks on the coordinates (56, 303) where the EditText is located, and then sends the keys "Atlanta" to input the city name. Since we don't have a specific resource ID for the EditText, we're using the coordinates as the primary method of interaction, as per the requirements.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/alertTitle, (48, 254), click, "Search for city"): Click on the title of the search dialog. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the dialog remains unchanged after the interaction.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, , (56, 282), click, "Atlanta"): Click to select the text "Atlanta" in the search input field. No new page or widgets appear after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (143, 334), click, "CANCEL"): Click the CANCEL button to dismiss the city search dialog and return to the main weather display for Atlanta, showing current temperature, weather conditions, and forecast details.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (220, 334), click, "OK"): Click the OK button to confirm the city search for "Atlanta". This action leads to a new page displaying weather information for Atlanta, US, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and a forecast tab view.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've successfully clicked on the search icon to open the search dialog.
2. We've entered "Atlanta" into the search field.

The next logical step in the source test case is to clear the search query. However, in the target app, we don't see a clear button in the current page's intent description. Instead, we have options to either cancel or confirm the search.

Given this difference, we'll adapt our approach and confirm the search instead of clearing it. This aligns with the overall goal of testing the search functionality.

Here's the next action I recommend:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (220, 334), click, NULL): Click the OK button to confirm the city search for "Atlanta" and display weather information for Atlanta.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 2 in the source test case (entering the city name) and implicitly includes confirming the search. It adapts to the different UI structure of the target app while maintaining the functional goal of searching for a city's weather.
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(220, 334)
···

This code uses the coordinates (220, 334) to click the OK button, which confirms the city search for "Atlanta" and displays weather information for Atlanta. Using coordinates is the optimal choice as per the requirements, and it's the most precise method to interact with the specific UI element.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step in the test case migration:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, , (16, 38), isDisplayed): Verify that the city name "Atlanta, US" is displayed on the main weather page after the search.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/action_search, (232, 28), click, NULL): Click on the search icon again to open the search dialog for the next step.
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've successfully completed the first two steps of the source test case: opening the search interface and inputting "Atlanta".
2. The third step in the source test case is to clear the query, but in this target app, we need to verify that the search was successful before proceeding.
3. Therefore, I've added an assertion to check if "Atlanta, US" is displayed on the main page, confirming that the search was successful.
4. To proceed with the next step (clearing the query), we need to open the search dialog again. So, I've included an action to click on the search icon.

This approach ensures that we're following the functional flow of the source test case while adapting to the specific UI and interaction patterns of the target app.
Based on the provided actions, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
assert d(text="Atlanta, US").exists()
d.click(232, 28)
···
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/alertTitle, (48, 275), click, "Search for city"): Click on the title of the search dialog. This action does not lead to a new page or cause any visible changes in the dialog's structure.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, , (56, 303), click, NULL): Click on the search input field to enter a city name. The page remains the same with the search dialog open, containing an editable text field for city input and "CANCEL" and "OK" buttons.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (143, 355), click, "CANCEL"): Click to cancel the search operation and return to the main weather display page without making any changes. The page after clicking this button shows the current weather information for Atlanta, US, including temperature, description, wind, pressure, humidity, sunrise, and sunset times.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (220, 355), click, "OK"): Click the OK button to confirm the city search. The page returns to the main weather display for Atlanta, US, showing updated weather information including temperature, wind, pressure, humidity, and forecast details.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll proceed with the next step of the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation:

1. We've successfully searched for "Atlanta" and verified its display.
2. We've opened the search dialog again.

The next step in the source test case is to clear the search query. In the target app, we don't have a direct "clear query" button, but we can achieve the same functionality by entering an empty string and confirming the search. Here's the next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, , (56, 303), input, ""): Clear the search field by inputting an empty string.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (220, 355), click, "OK"): Click the OK button to confirm the empty search, effectively clearing the previous search.
ASSERT (android.widget.EditText, , (56, 303), isDisplayed): Verify that the search text field is still visible after clearing the query.
~~~

This response combines steps 3 and 4 of the source test case. We're clearing the search query and then verifying that the search field is still visible. The assertion is placed after clicking the OK button to ensure we're back on the main page where the search field should be visible.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d(resourceId="android:id/search_src_text").set_text("")
d.click(220, 355)
assert d(resourceId="android:id/search_src_text").exists()
···

This code performs the following actions:
1. Clears the search field by setting its text to an empty string.
2. Clicks the OK button at the specified coordinates (220, 355).
3. Verifies that the search text field is still visible after clearing the query.

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated the first three steps of the source test case. We have opened the search dialog, entered a city name, and cleared the search query. The next step in the source test case is to verify that the search text field is still visible after clearing the query, which we have also completed. 

The final step in the source test case is to return to the previous state. Let's proceed with this step:

~~~
RETURN: Return to the main weather page by closing the search dialog
DONE
~~~

This action will close the search dialog and return to the main weather page, completing the migration of all steps from the source test case to the target application. The "DONE" indicates that we have successfully matched and migrated all steps of the source test case to the target app.
Based on the given input, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to return to the main weather page by closing the search dialog:

···
d.press('back')
···

This code uses the device variable name 'd' as specified, and performs a 'back' action to close the search dialog and return to the main weather page. The 'press('back')' method is a common operation in UIAutomator2 for navigating back in Android applications.
