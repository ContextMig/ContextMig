#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case is to open the navigation drawer. Let's find a suitable action in the target app that corresponds to this step.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (280, 28), click, NULL):Click on "More options" to open a menu with options including Weather Map, Graphs, Detect Location, Settings, and About.
~~~

This action seems to be the closest match to opening a navigation drawer or accessing a menu in the target app. It opens a menu with various options, including Settings, which aligns with the next steps in the source test case. Let's proceed with this action and see how it aligns with the source test case flow.
Based on the given action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to click on the "More options" button:

···
d.click(280, 28)
···

This code uses the coordinates provided (280, 28) to perform a click action on the "More options" button, which is described as an android.widget.ImageView. Using coordinates is the optimal choice as per the requirements, and it's precise in this case.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (120, 28), click, NULL): Click on the "Weather Map" option in the menu. This action does not navigate to a new page, as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON, indicating that the menu remains open after the click.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/title, (136, 41), click, "Weather Map"): Click on "Weather Map" to open the weather map page. The new page displays a WebView with zoom controls and a bottom bar with options for Rain, Wind, and Temperature map layers.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/title, (136, 137), click, "Detect Location"): Click to detect the current location. A dialog appears with a message "Getting your location ..." and a "CANCEL" button with id "android:id/button2".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/title, (136, 185), click, "Settings"): Click on the "Settings" option to navigate to the Settings page, which contains various configuration options such as temperature units, length units, speed units, pressure units, and date format settings.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/title, (136, 233), click, "About"): Click on the "About" option to open the About dialog, which displays information about the app including its version, developers, data sources, and licensing details.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with opening the navigation drawer, but in the target app, we've already clicked on the "More options" menu. This suggests that the navigation structure is different between the two apps. Let's proceed with the next step that aligns with the source test case's intention of accessing the settings.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, cz.martykan.forecastie:id/title, (136, 185), click, NULL):Click on the "Settings" option to navigate to the Settings page
~~~

This action corresponds to steps 1 and 2 of the source test case, where the user navigates to the Settings page. In the target app, we can directly access Settings from the opened menu, which combines these two steps into one.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.click(136, 185)
···

This code uses the coordinates (136, 185) to click on the "Settings" option, which should navigate to the Settings page. The coordinate-based approach is preferred as per the requirements, and it's the most direct way to perform this action.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears we are currently at the Settings page of the target application. Let's proceed with the test case migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, android:id/list, (0, 80), click, NULL):Click on the settings list to view or modify various app settings
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (0, 80), "Units"):Verify that the "Units" section is present in the settings list
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (16, 335), click, "Speed units"):Click to open the Speed units selection dialog
~~~

Explanation:
1. We start by clicking on the settings list, which corresponds to step 3 in the source test case where we click on an item in the settings list.
2. We then assert the presence of the "Units" section to ensure we're on the correct settings page.
3. Finally, we click on the "Speed units" option, which is similar to step 4 in the source test case where we click on an item in the sub-settings list.

This migration takes into account that the target app might have a slightly different structure than the source app, but we're still aiming to achieve similar functionality. We're focusing on the speed units setting, which seems to be the closest match to the "30 minutes" setting in the source test case (possibly related to update frequency).
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(0, 80)
assert d(resourceId="android:id/title", text="Units").exists()
d.click(16, 335)
···

This code performs the following actions:

1. Clicks on the settings list at coordinates (0, 80).
2. Verifies that the "Units" section is present in the settings list.
3. Clicks on the "Speed units" option at coordinates (16, 335) to open the selection dialog.

The code uses coordinates for clicking actions as requested, and uses the resourceId and text attributes for the assertion. The device variable name 'd' is used as specified in the input.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (40, 175), click, "Speed units"): Click on the title "Speed units" of the dialog. This action does not change the page, as the dialog remains open with the same options for selecting speed units.
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 211), click, "Meters per second (m/s)"): Click to select Meters per second (m/s) as the speed unit. The selection dialog remains open with the chosen option now checked.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (215, 455), click, "CANCEL"): Click to cancel the speed unit selection and return to the main settings page without making changes.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently at the step where the source test case is clicking on the fourth item (index 3) in the sub-settings list. The executed action sequence shows that we have navigated to the Settings page, clicked on the "Units" section, and opened the "Speed units" selection dialog. Therefore, the next step would be:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 211), click, "Meters per second (m/s)"):Select "Meters per second (m/s)" as the speed unit from the dialog options
~~~

This matches the step "ACTION (CheckedTextView, , (), click, NULL): Select the second option (index 1) in the dialog that appears" from the source test case semantics. Please note that I have provided the specific element details (android.widget.CheckedTextView and android:id/text1) based on the current page's intent description.
To perform the described action using UIAutomator2 in Python, the code would be:

```
d.click(16, 211)
d(resourceId="android:id/text1", text="Meters per second (m/s)").click()
```

This code first clicks at the coordinates (16, 211) to ensure the dialog is focused. Then, it finds the UI element with the resource ID "android:id/text1" and the text "Meters per second (m/s)", and clicks on it to select that option.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we are currently on step 4 of the source test case, which involves selecting a specific setting option. Let's proceed with the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/summary, (16, 357), click, "Meters per second (m/s)"):Click to open the Speed units selection dialog to verify the selected option
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/summary, (16, 357), "Meters per second (m/s)"):Verify that the selected speed unit is "Meters per second (m/s)"
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've already navigated to the Settings page and selected the Speed units option.
2. The next step is to verify that the correct option has been selected.
3. We're clicking on the summary text to open the dialog again, which allows us to see the currently selected option.
4. Then, we're asserting that the summary text displays "Meters per second (m/s)" to confirm the correct selection.

This action corresponds to steps 4 and 5 of the source test case, where a specific option is selected from a settings list. Although the exact setting (update frequency in the source vs. speed units in the target) is different, the functional flow of selecting a specific option from a settings list is maintained.
Based on the provided actions, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(16, 357)
assert d(resourceId="android:id/summary").get_text() == "Meters per second (m/s)"
···

This code performs the following actions:

1. Clicks on the coordinates (16, 357) to open the Speed units selection dialog.
2. Verifies that the text of the element with the resource ID "android:id/summary" is "Meters per second (m/s)".

The code uses coordinates for the click action as specified in the requirements, and uses the resource ID for the assertion, which is the most reliable method when coordinates are not provided.

Based on the provided information, I'll continue the test case migration. Here's the next step:

~~~
RETURN:Return to the previous screen (Settings page)
~~~

Explanation:
1. We've completed steps 1-5 of the source test case, which involved navigating to settings and selecting an option.
2. Step 6 of the source test case was to verify a specific selection, which we've already done in the last executed action (verifying "Meters per second (m/s)").
3. The next step (step 7) in the source test case is to return to the previous screens.
4. Therefore, the appropriate next action is to return to the previous screen, which is the main Settings page.

This action aligns with the source test case's step 7, which involves returning to previous screens. We're taking it one step at a time to ensure proper navigation.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code for the given action:

···
d.press('back')
···

This code uses the device variable name 'd' as specified, and performs the action of returning to the previous screen (Settings page) by pressing the back button.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll continue the test case migration. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next step:

1. We've already navigated to the Settings page and modified the Speed units setting.
2. The next step in the source test case is to verify a specific setting (step 6), but it's related to a time interval, which we haven't encountered yet.
3. We should continue exploring the settings to find a similar option or move to the next relevant step.

Given this, here's the next action I propose:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (16, 483), click, "Date Format"):Click to open Date Format settings to explore time-related options
~~~

This action aims to explore time-related settings, which might be relevant to the "30 minutes" verification in the source test case. If this doesn't lead us to the desired option, we'll need to adjust our approach in the next step.
Based on the given action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(16, 483)
···

This code uses the coordinates (16, 483) to perform a click action, which should open the Date Format settings as described in the action. This approach is preferred as it directly uses the precise coordinates provided in the input.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (40, 175), click, "Date Format"): Click on the "Date Format" text to select the desired date format option from the list.
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 211), click, "Fri 15.01.2016 - 05:00"): Click to select the date format "Fri 15.01.2016 - 05:00". This action updates the selected date format in the settings dialog.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (215, 455), click, "CANCEL"): Click to cancel the date format selection and return to the Settings page without making changes. The next page shows the Settings list with options like Temperature units, Length units, Speed units, Pressure units, and Date Format.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, I'll continue the test case migration. The next step should focus on selecting a date format option, which aligns with step 5 of the source test case where a selection is made from a dialog. Here's the next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 211), click, "Fri 15.01.2016 - 05:00"):Select "Fri 15.01.2016 - 05:00" as the date format from the dialog options
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/summary, (16, 505), "Fri 15.01.2016 - 05:00"):Verify that the selected date format is "Fri 15.01.2016 - 05:00"
~~~

This action corresponds to step 5 in the source test case, where a selection is made from a dialog. The assertion is added to verify the selection, which aligns with step 6 in the source test case. The next step would be to return to the main settings page, but we'll wait for the result of this action before proceeding.
Based on the provided actions and requirements, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

```
d.click(16, 211)
assert d(resourceId="android:id/summary").get_text() == "Fri 15.01.2016 - 05:00"
```

This code performs the following actions:

1. Clicks on the CheckedTextView at coordinates (16, 211) to select the date format "Fri 15.01.2016 - 05:00".
2. Verifies that the selected date format is displayed correctly in the summary TextView.

The code uses coordinates for the click action as requested, and uses the resourceId for the assertion, which is the preferred method when the ID is available and unique.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (40, 175), click, "Date Format"): Click on the "Date Format" text to select the desired date format option from the list.
ACTION (android.widget.CheckedTextView, android:id/text1, (16, 211), click, "Fri 15.01.2016 - 05:00"): Click to select the date format "Fri 15.01.2016 - 05:00". This action updates the selected date format in the settings dialog.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (215, 455), click, "CANCEL"): Click to cancel the date format selection and return to the Settings page without making changes. The next page shows the Settings list with options like Temperature units, Length units, Speed units, Pressure units, and Date Format.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have already executed several steps in the target application that correspond to the source test case. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next step:

1. We've already navigated to the Settings page, which corresponds to steps 1 and 2 of the source test case.
2. We've interacted with various settings options, including Speed units and Date Format, which partially covers steps 3 and 4 of the source test case.
3. The last executed action was selecting a date format, which doesn't directly correspond to any step in the source test case.

The next logical step would be to find an option that corresponds to step 4 of the source test case, which involves clicking on the fourth item in the sub-settings list. Based on the current page's intent description, we don't have a direct match for this. However, we can continue exploring the settings to find an option that might be similar to the one in the source test case (which seems to be related to a time interval).

Given this analysis, here's the next recommended action:

~~~
RETURN:Return to the main Settings page to explore other options
~~~

This action will allow us to go back to the main Settings page and look for an option that might correspond to the time interval setting in the source test case. After executing this action, we'll need to reassess the available options on the new page to determine the next appropriate step in the test migration process.
Based on the provided action, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.press('back')
···

This code uses the device variable name 'd' as specified, and implements the RETURN action by pressing the back button to return to the main Settings page.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it seems you have already executed several actions related to the Settings page and its various options. The next step in the source test case is:

```
6. ASSERT (TextView, android.R.id.summary, (), "30 minutes"): Verify that the selected option's summary text is "30 minutes".
```

To match this step, we need to find an option related to a time interval or refresh rate, and verify that its summary text displays "30 minutes". Let's examine the intentions for the current page:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (16, 132), click, "Temperature units"):Click to open temperature units selection dialog. The new dialog contains options for Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin with ids "android:id/text1" for each option.
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/summary, (16, 357), "Meters per second (m/s)"):Verify that the selected speed unit is "Meters per second (m/s)"
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, , (0, 190), click, NULL):Click to toggle the option "Show temperature only as an integer". This action does not navigate to a new page, but toggles the checkbox with id "android:id/checkbox" within the same LinearLayout.
~~~

The intention "Click to toggle the option "Show temperature only as an integer"" seems related to displaying temperature values, but it does not mention any time interval or refresh rate. Therefore, it is unlikely to match the source test case step we are looking for.

However, there is another intention that could potentially match:

```
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (16, 261), click, "Length units"):Click on "Length units" to open a dialog for selecting length units. The dialog contains options "Millimeters (mm)" and "Inches (in)" with ids "android:id/text1", and a "CANCEL" button with id "android:id/button2".
```

This intention mentions opening a dialog for selecting length units, which may also include an option related to a time interval or refresh rate. Let's explore this path:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (16, 261), click, "Length units"):Click on "Length units" to open the length units selection dialog
~~~

If this action successfully opens a dialog containing an option with a summary text of "30 minutes", we can proceed with the assertion:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/summary, (), "30 minutes"):Verify that the selected option's summary text is "30 minutes"
~~~

Otherwise, if the "Length units" dialog does not contain the desired option, we can respond with:

~~~
NOT FOUND
~~~

And explore other intentions on the current page for a potential match.
I'll convert the given actions into UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the provided information. Here's the code:

```
# Verify that the selected option's summary text is "30 minutes"
assert d(resourceId="android.R.id.summary").get_text() == "30 minutes"

# Click to open temperature units selection dialog
d.click(16, 132)

# Verify that the selected speed unit is "Meters per second (m/s)"
assert d(resourceId="android:id/summary").get_text() == "Meters per second (m/s)"

# Click to toggle the option "Show temperature only as an integer"
d.click(0, 190)

# Click on "Length units" to open a dialog for selecting length units
d.click(16, 261)

# Click on "Length units" to open the length units selection dialog
d.click(16, 261)

# Verify that the selected option's summary text is "30 minutes"
assert d(resourceId="android:id/summary").get_text() == "30 minutes"
```

Note: The last action "NOT FOUND" was not included in the code as it doesn't represent a valid action or assertion.
