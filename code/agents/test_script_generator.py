Give you android test semantic of Actions Input. Please assist in converting the test semantic descriptions into UIAutomator2 code in Python. 

### Requirements:

#### We've already initiated the app and connected to it using `u2.connect('ip')`. The code should be encapsulated using '···' . 
#### When transforming the actions/asserts description, prefer to use coordinates if they are precise. If not, and if the ID is unique and non-empty, you also can use the ID. 
#### You also can use the text attribute when the widget's text is confirmed (the text is the value of the input : ACTION (element, id, coordinates, action, value)).
#### You should remember: problematic Codes – A list of previously generated code snippets that failed execution. These should be avoided in new outputs to prevent redundant failures.
      Failure Reasons – A list of corresponding reasons why each problematic code failed. This information should guide modifications in the new test code.
#### Do not repeat problematic code snippets from problematic_codes. If an action previously failed, attempt an alternative approach.
#### Use failure_reasons to adjust strategy:
#### If a coordinate-based click failed due to UI layout changes, attempt an ID-based interaction.
#### If an input operation failed, ensure set_text() is correctly used.
#### If an assertion failed, consider adjusting index selection or verification logic.
#### If an ID-based operation fails **for any reason**, prefer using **coordinates first** if they are stable and accurate.


### Some common operations:

1. To press enter in uiautomator code, it should be device.press('enter').
2. To press back in uiautomator code, it should be device.press('back').
3. To long click in uiautomator code, it should be d(resourceId=id).long_click(1) or d.long_click(x, y, 1) or d(text='content').long_click(1), do not miss the time: 1
4. To swipe in uiautomator code, it should be d.swipe(from_x, from_y, to_x, to_y).
5. To click the UI element with the designated text attribute in uiautomator code, it should be device(text="value").click(). value cannot be NULL and you must not respond the combination of text and coordinates 'd(text="xxx").click(x=0, y=49)'
6. To set text to input box, if you know widget id of input box, it should be d.click(x, y) and then d(resourceId="id").set_text("content"), else it should be d.click(x, y) and then d.send_keys("content")

### Input Format:

The first parameter is mandatory, while the subsequent three parameters are optional and can be combined freely:

···
Uiautomator2 device variable name:device(this variable name is defined by u2.connect('ip ') and will affect the uiautomator2 variable name in the output.)
ASSERT (element, id, coordinates, oracle):purpose': Provide an assertion to verify if an action has been implemented according to the description.
ACTION (element, id, coordinates, action, value):purpose': Indicate which UI element to interact with (click, long click, input). For input actions, use 'Input' (NULL to clear input; "" to enter a random string). For other actions, the value should be NULL.
RETURN:purpose': Describe the purpose of going back in the navigation flow.
···

### Output Format(The code should be wrapped using '···'). Avoid adding extra information beyond the requested format. Use the following structure for generating UIAutomator2 code,combine the following options as needed:
···
device.click(x1, y1)
device.press('back')
device(resourceId="id0").click()
d(resourceId="id3").swipe("right")
device(text="Delete").click()
device.press('enter')
d(resourceId="id").set_text("content")
device.xpath('//*[@resource-id="id2"]/android.widget.xxx').click()
device(className="android.widget.xx", resourceId="android:id/id1") .child_by_text("xx", className="android.widget.yy") .child(className="android.widget.zz").click()
assert device(resourceId="id3", className="android.widget.kk").get_text() == "y"
···

### Example:

Certainly, a single line of input(action) can correspond to multiple outputs. For example: "Input the URL into the search field and press enter." You should first generate device.send_keys(URL), followed by device.press('enter').

#### Input:

Uiautomator2 device variable name:device

ASSERT (TextView, privacyfriendlyshoppinglist.secuso.org.privacyfriendlyshoppinglist:id/textview_product_name, (24, 88), "Meat"): Verify that the 'Meat' item is first in the list to ensure correct sorting.
ASSERT (TextView, privacyfriendlyshoppinglist.secuso.org.privacyfriendlyshoppinglist:id/textview_product_name, (24, 168), "Egg"): Confirm that 'Egg' is second, verifying the sort order.
ASSERT (TextView, privacyfriendlyshoppinglist.secuso.org.privacyfriendlyshoppinglist:id/textview_product_name, (24, 248), "Noodles"): Check that 'Noodles' appears last, ensuring sort order.


#### Output(The code should be wrapped using '···'):
···
assert (device(resourceId="privacyfriendlyshoppinglist.secuso.org.privacyfriendlyshoppinglist:id/textview_product_name", index=0).get_text() == "Meat")
assert (device(resourceId="privacyfriendlyshoppinglist.secuso.org.privacyfriendlyshoppinglist:id/textview_product_name", index=1).get_text() == "Egg")
assert (device(resourceId="privacyfriendlyshoppinglist.secuso.org.privacyfriendlyshoppinglist:id/textview_product_name", index=2).get_text() == "Noodles")
···


You only need to convert the content corresponding to Actions into uiautomator2 code. 
Your optimal choice is to operate based on coordinates. When inputting text, prefer to use the widget id. Ensure that the code is unique and do not provide similar codes.
If you use a widget id, the id is missing the package_name prefix（package_name is provided later）and :id/, which you need to fill in, for example, packagename + ':id/' + id: Privacyfriendlyshoppinglist.secuso.org.privacyfriendlyshoppinglist:id/imageview_sort. 
The following is the parameter information that will be entered soon: 
If the action is `click`, only generate `click()` without `set_text()`.
